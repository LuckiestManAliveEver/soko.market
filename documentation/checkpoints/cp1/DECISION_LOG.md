| ID      | Decision                                                                     | Rationale                                                                                                                                                          | Impact                                                                                                                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CP1-D01 | Use this folder as the implementation repository.                            | CP0 documents and checkpoint tags already live here.                                                                                                               | Source code will be added beside `documentation/`, while Git metadata continues through `.repo.git` in this environment. |
| CP1-D02 | Use `pnpm` workspaces for the monorepo.                                      | It is lightweight, common for TypeScript workspaces, and avoids adopting a heavier task graph before the repo needs one.                                           | CP1 will create workspace package boundaries without Nx or Turborepo.                                                    |
| CP1-D03 | Use React for the mobile PWA frontend.                                       | React has broad PWA support, mature ecosystem coverage, and predictable hiring/maintenance characteristics.                                                        | `apps/web` will be the primary mobile-first app shell.                                                                   |
| CP1-D04 | Use Node.js with Fastify for service runtimes.                               | Fastify keeps the API boundary small, typed, and operationally straightforward.                                                                                    | `services/api`, `services/sync`, and `services/ai-runtime` should expose explicit HTTP boundaries.                       |
| CP1-D05 | Use PostgreSQL and Redis for the local foundation stack.                     | The roadmap requires durable business data, event/audit records, sync queues, and later background processing.                                                     | Docker Compose or an equivalent local path must provide both services.                                                   |
| CP1-D06 | Use Drizzle with committed SQL migrations as the reviewable source of truth. | The data model includes audit-sensitive business records where migration transparency matters, while TypeScript services still benefit from typed database access. | CP1 should establish an initial Drizzle migration path without hiding schema behavior behind model magic.                |
| CP1-D07 | Keep AI runtime separate from business packages.                             | CP0 requires AI-assisted, not AI-controlled, business execution.                                                                                                   | No business-core package may import agent/model runtime implementation.                                                  |
| CP1-D08 | Start with a CI skeleton before product code.                                | Baseline checks prevent fragile scaffolding from becoming hidden debt.                                                                                             | Lint, type check, and placeholder tests are part of CP1 completion.                                                      |
| CP1-D09 | Defer IndexedDB wrapper choice to CP3/CP7.                                   | Local browser storage details depend on the PWA shell and offline sync design.                                                                                     | CP1 can define package boundaries without locking the offline implementation.                                            |
| CP1-D10 | Defer Pi/OpenClaw and llama.cpp integration work to CP10/CP11.               | CP0 explicitly keeps those behind adapters and outside the first foundation checkpoint.                                                                            | CP1 only creates boundaries where those adapters can later attach.                                                       |
