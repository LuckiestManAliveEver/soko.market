## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

1. AI does not directly mutate business records.
2. Business Runtime owns correctness.
3. Tool Executor is the only path to business actions.
4. Verification precedes state-changing actions.
5. High and critical risk actions require confirmation.
6. Events are immutable.
7. Offline conflicts involving money, tax, invoice totals, discounts, or product quantity are not auto-resolved.
8. Payment state is verified server-side.
9. General host tools are not exposed to merchant-facing agents.
10. The app remains mobile-first and usable on low-end Android targets.
