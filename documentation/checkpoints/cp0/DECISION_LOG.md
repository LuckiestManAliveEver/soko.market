## Accepted Decisions

| ID      | Decision                                                                                         | Rationale                                                                                          | Impact                                                                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CP0-D01 | The Master Control Document is the highest authority.                                            | It explicitly supersedes conflicting content in Docs 1 to 3.                                       | All roadmap conflicts are resolved through the control document first.           |
| CP0-D02 | `documentation/README.md` is the clean entry point for humans.                                   | The source folder contains PDFs, DOCX duplicates, screenshots, and one broken placeholder.         | Readers can start from one harmonized file.                                      |
| CP0-D03 | The broken `Soko doc 4 June .pdf` is excluded from authority.                                    | It contains only `Soko.markeyl`.                                                                   | The real Document 4 is `Soko doc 4 June  (1).pdf`.                               |
| CP0-D04 | MVP starts with a rule-based parser, not full local LLM.                                         | The Master Control Document requires AI entry in Sprint 1 as a thin command parser.                | Product proves chat-first behavior before adopting heavier model infrastructure. |
| CP0-D05 | Pi/OpenClaw-style harness is treated as an adapter candidate for Sokoclaw, not as the whole app. | Agent harnesses are useful for orchestration but should not own business truth.                    | Keeps business logic deterministic and auditable.                                |
| CP0-D06 | llama.cpp is treated as a model provider, not as a runtime owner.                                | llama.cpp is suitable for local inference, but business state must remain outside it.              | Keeps local model implementation replaceable.                                    |
| CP0-D07 | General host tools must not be exposed to merchant-facing agents.                                | Shell/filesystem/browser tools are too risky for payments, stock, invoices, and customer data.     | Only Soko-owned tools are exposed to business workflows.                         |
| CP0-D08 | UI follows the PNG operational style while preserving chat-first navigation.                     | The PNGs match M-Pesa familiarity and low-end Android usability.                                   | Support screens use cards, large tap targets, and green confirmation actions.    |
| CP0-D09 | Marketplace is post-launch, not MVP.                                                             | The Master Control Document defers marketplace until adoption and sync stability triggers are met. | MVP avoids premature platform complexity.                                        |
| CP0-D10 | TIEL is planned after core commerce stability.                                                   | Cryptographic identity is valuable but too heavy for initial commerce proof.                       | MVP can proceed with standard auth and trust-level placeholders.                 |
| CP0-D11 | Rollback points are feature and checkpoint based.                                                | Database rollback is dangerous for payments, invoices, tax, and inventory.                         | Prefer feature flags and prior deployment artifacts before destructive rollback. |

| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CP0-D12 | Initial model candidates are Qwen3-1.7B GGUF Q4 as the primary CP11 local text candidate, Qwen3-4B GGUF Q4 as the higher-end local candidate, and Gemma 3n E2B IT as a multimodal research candidate only. The core PWA must remain usable on low-end Android devices tested at 1 GB and 2 GB RAM. Local LLM support is optional and requires 64-bit device capability detection, at least 4 GB RAM, and rule/cloud fallback below that.                                                        | CP0 already keeps MVP AI rule-based and CP11 local inference optional. Qwen3 gives small multilingual/tool-capable candidates; Gemma 3n is useful for later multimodal tests but carries a separate Gemma license, so it should not be the default merchant-chat baseline. The device floor protects the low-end Android target from being blocked by local inference. | CP4 stays rule-parser first. CP11 gets concrete model candidates, GGUF metadata, benchmark fixtures, and capability gates. Devices below the local-LLM floor must use deterministic parsing or cloud fallback. |
| CP0-D13 | First production hosting target is AWS: CloudFront plus S3 for web PWA assets, ECS on Fargate for API/sync/AI-runtime containers, RDS for PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Valkey or Redis for cache/queues, S3 for object storage/backups, and CloudWatch for logs/metrics. Prefer Africa (Cape Town) if all required services and payment-provider connectivity are available; otherwise use the nearest stable Europe region and record latency tests. Do not start new production on AWS App Runner. | The repo is already shaped around containerized Node/Fastify services, PostgreSQL, Redis, object storage, HTTPS webhooks, logs, and later AI runtime isolation. AWS has managed primitives for those needs and a South Africa region option. AWS App Runner is excluded because AWS says it no longer accepts new customers from 2026-04-30.                           | CP15/CP16 deployment work should produce AWS infrastructure-as-code and runbooks. Hosting-specific assumptions must stay behind environment configuration so a later migration remains possible.               |

## CP1 Transition Notes

On 2026-07-02, CP1 was formally opened. Decisions required before CP1 are resolved in `documentation/checkpoints/cp1/DECISION_LOG.md`.

## Decision Change Procedure

To change a CP0 decision:

1. Add a new decision row.
2. Reference the decision being superseded.
3. Explain the technical or product reason.
4. Update `documentation/README.md` if the roadmap changes.
5. Update checkpoint rollback instructions if risk changes.
