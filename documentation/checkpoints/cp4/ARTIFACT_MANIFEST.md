| `packages/tool-core/src/index.ts` | Parser contract, intent taxonomy, confidence scoring, and slot logic. |
| `apps/web/package.json`           | Adds the web app dependency on `@soko/tool-core`.                     |
| `apps/web/src/main.tsx`           | Integrates parser output into the CP3 chat shell.                     |
| `apps/web/src/cp3-shell.ts`       | Updates initial chat copy for CP4 parser behavior.                    |
| `tests/ai-eval/cp4-commands.ts`   | Internal command dataset for parser evaluation.                       |
| `tests/cp4-rule-parser.test.ts`   | Parser, confidence, clarification, and non-mutation tests.            |
| `tests/cp3-shell.test.ts`         | Updated shell contract test for CP4 chat copy.                        |
