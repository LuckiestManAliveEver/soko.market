# Soko.market Documentation Readme

This folder contains the planning, architecture, runtime, product, and control documents for Soko.market.

Soko.market is a mobile-first, offline-capable, AI-assisted business operating system for informal and small businesses. The core product goal is to let merchants manage products, customers, invoices, payments, inventory, debt, reports, and eventually marketplace skills through a chat-first interface that still exposes clear mobile screens for confirmation and review.

## Core Implementation Principles

These principles should govern all implementation decisions:

1. Mobile first
   - The reference device is a low-end Android phone.
   - The app shell must stay lightweight.
   - Tap targets must be large and workflows short.

2. Chat first, not chat only
   - Every important workflow must be reachable from chat.
   - Structured cards and forms are allowed for confirmation, review, correction, and fallback.

3. Offline first
   - Critical workflows must work without connectivity.
   - Local writes create local events.
   - Sync happens later through a controlled queue.

4. AI assisted, not AI controlled
   - AI can interpret, plan, draft, summarize, recommend, and prepare actions.
   - Business-changing actions must go through tools, permission checks, deterministic business rules, and confirmation where required.

5. Deterministic business runtime
   - Products, invoices, payments, inventory, tax, credit, and reports must not depend on model output for correctness.
   - The AI proposes; the Business Runtime validates and executes.

6. Event driven and auditable
   - Every important mutation emits an immutable event.
   - Events power sync, audit logs, reports, notifications, and knowledge generation.

7. Replaceable AI infrastructure
   - Sokoclaw should be model-agnostic.
   - A Pi/OpenClaw-style agent harness may implement the orchestration loop.
   - llama.cpp may provide local inference through a model adapter.
   - Neither should own business data or bypass Soko tools.

## Target System Shape

```text
Mobile PWA / optional native shell
  -> Application Runtime
      -> chat UI
      -> support screens
      -> local storage
      -> offline queue
      -> sync status

  -> Sokoclaw Runtime
      -> conversation manager
      -> context builder
      -> intent router
      -> planner
      -> task scheduler
      -> model router
      -> memory engine
      -> skill manager
      -> tool executor
      -> verification engine
      -> response generator

  -> Business Runtime
      -> products
      -> customers
      -> suppliers
      -> invoices
      -> payments
      -> inventory
      -> credit
      -> logistics
      -> tax
      -> reports

  -> Data and Sync Runtime
      -> local database
      -> event log
      -> sync queue
      -> cloud PostgreSQL
      -> object storage
      -> audit logs
```

## AI and Model Integration Position

Use a clean adapter boundary:

```text
Sokoclaw Runtime API
  -> AgentHarnessAdapter
      -> Pi/OpenClaw-style harness, if adopted

  -> ModelProviderAdapter
      -> rule-based parser
      -> llama.cpp server
      -> cloud model fallback

  -> ToolRegistry
      -> Soko business tools only
```

Rules:

- Do not fork llama.cpp unless a specific missing feature requires it.
- Prefer `llama-server` or a thin native/mobile adapter behind `ModelProviderAdapter`.
- Do not expose shell, browser, filesystem, or arbitrary host tools to merchant-facing agents.
- Expose only Soko-owned tools such as `create_invoice`, `add_product`, `record_payment`, `check_stock`, `generate_report`, `import_document`, `send_invoice`, and `queue_sync`.
- Keep all sensitive actions behind confirmation and audit logging.

## UI Direction

The PNG screenshots define the expected mobile feel:

- White or light background.
- Green primary action color.
- Rounded but restrained cards.
- Large touch targets.
- Bottom primary action button for confirmation screens.
- Quick action grid for common operations.
- Simple item cards with price, label, and one obvious action.
- M-Pesa and phone-number flows should feel familiar to users in Kenya.

The correct product pattern is:

```text
User starts from chat or quick action
  -> agent interprets or opens structured support screen
  -> preview card appears
  -> user confirms or edits
  -> Business Runtime executes
  -> event is recorded
  -> sync queue updates
  -> agent reports result
```

## Development Roadmap

Source:

- `documentation/Soko_Global_Shop_ID_Concept.docx`
- `documentation/CP18_GLOBAL_SHOP_ID.md`

Core concept:

```text
The BigFish soko: 254A12567835
```

Where:

- `254` is the country namespace.
- `A` is the Business Agent identifier prefix.
- `12567835` is the unique global shop identifier.

Deliverables:

- Stable global shop ID generation using the compact `countryA########` format.

- Rollback action: hide Soko ID surfaces while preserving generated IDs and keeping existing storefront URLs/contact workflows active.

### CP19: Continuous Learning Architecture

Goal:

- Prepare a future continual learning layer for Soko.market and the Sokoclaw runtime without making model fine-tuning the primary path for improvement.
- Status: planned future expansion.

Source:

- `documentation/Soko.market_Continuous_Learning_Architecture_v1.pdf`
- `documentation/CP19_CONTINUOUS_LEARNING.md`

Core concept:

- The intelligence of Soko.market lives primarily in the runtime rather than the language model.
- Runtime traces, memory, skills, evaluation, and production feedback should improve the platform while deterministic business tools remain authoritative.

Deliverables:

- Trace capture for execution graphs, tool calls, outcomes, corrections, latency, and errors.
- Unified memory engine for shop, customer, supplier, inventory, market, and runtime memories.
- Outcome classification for success, failure, and partial success.

- Production intelligence dashboard for clustered failures and improvement candidates.

Exit criteria:

- Tenant data remains isolated and privacy-controlled.
- Runtime improvements cannot bypass Soko business validators, confirmation gates, RBAC, audit logging, or rollback rules.
- Promoted skills are versioned, tested, permissioned, and reversible.
- Every runtime improvement passes SokoBench before production deployment.
- Human review is required before approved improvements benefit stores.

Rollback point:

- Tag: `checkpoint/cp19-continuous-learning`
- Backup: learning configuration, trace schema, memory promotion rules, skill registry, evaluation baselines, and approved improvement manifests.
- Rollback action: disable learning-derived runtime changes and restore the previous deterministic runtime configuration while preserving traces according to retention policy.

## Standard Checkpoint Procedure

Every checkpoint must follow the same procedure:

1. Freeze scope.
   - No unrelated work enters the checkpoint branch.

2. Run verification.
   - Lint.
   - Type check.
   - Unit tests.
   - Integration tests.
   - Offline tests if applicable.
   - AI eval if runtime behavior changed.
   - Device/performance checks if UI or sync changed.

3. Capture evidence.
   - Test output.
   - Screenshots for UI checkpoints.
   - API examples for backend checkpoints.
   - Migration version.
   - Feature flag state.

4. Create a rollback tag.
   - Use the checkpoint tag names in this README.

5. Snapshot state.
   - Database schema.
   - Seed data or fixtures.
   - Object storage manifest where applicable.
   - Runtime/tool/model config.

6. Record known risks.
   - List what is not covered by tests.
   - List any feature flags left off.
   - List any manual recovery steps.

## Rollback Strategy

Rollback should prefer feature flags and previous deployment artifacts over destructive database reversions.

Use this order:

1. Disable the feature flag.
2. Route traffic back to previous service version.
3. Preserve new writes in an isolated queue or read-only state.
4. Restore from checkpoint snapshot only when data corruption is confirmed and recovery has been rehearsed.
5. Never silently discard payment, invoice, tax, or inventory events.

Data rollback rules:

- Payments: never overwrite silently; preserve both versions and require owner/admin resolution.
- Invoice totals, tax, and discount: block auto-resolution.
- Product quantity: block auto-resolution.
- Duplicate offline records: create both and flag for review.
- Delete/edit conflict: prefer edit and log deletion attempt.

## Recommended Immediate Next Step

Open CP10:

1. Create the CP10 baseline and decision log.
2. Define the Sokoclaw Runtime adapter contract around existing deterministic business tools.
3. Keep model output behind confirmation and server-side validators.
