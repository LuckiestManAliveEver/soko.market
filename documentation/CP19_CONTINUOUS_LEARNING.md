# CP19 Continuous Learning Architecture

CP19 is a future expansion checkpoint based on the continuous learning architecture note. It is not active implementation scope yet.

## Source Concept

Primary source:

- `documentation/Soko.market_Continuous_Learning_Architecture_v1.pdf`

The concept defines a continual learning system for Soko.market and the Sokoclaw runtime. The platform should improve primarily through runtime, memory, skills, evaluation, and production feedback rather than through direct model fine-tuning.

## Product Intent

Soko.market should become better at commerce tasks as stores use it, while preserving tenant isolation, deterministic business execution, human review, and model replaceability.

The core principle is:

```text
The intelligence of Soko.market lives primarily in the runtime rather than the language model.
```

Learning should improve:

- planning and routing
- prompt construction
- tool selection
- verification and retry behavior
- memory promotion
- reusable commerce skills
- evaluation coverage
- production failure analysis

## Learning Layers

The future architecture should treat learning as layered:

- Model layer: interchangeable LLMs behind provider adapters.
- Harness layer: planner, router, tool selection, prompts, retries, and verification.
- Context layer: business, customer, supplier, inventory, market, and runtime memory.
- Skill layer: reusable workflows extracted from successful executions.
- Ecosystem layer: anonymized learning shared across participating stores when permitted.

## Continuous Learning Pipeline

Planned pipeline:

```text
User request
-> execution graph
-> trace capture
-> validation
-> memory snapshot
-> outcome classification
-> pattern discovery
-> skill candidate detection
-> evaluation engine
-> runtime improvement proposal
-> human review
-> deployment
-> stores benefit
```

## Guardrails

Continuous learning must not bypass Soko's deterministic business runtime.

Required guardrails:

- Keep tenant data isolated.
- Do not train or promote private store data into shared assets without explicit policy and consent.
- Do not let model output directly mutate products, invoices, payments, tax, inventory, or customer balances.
- Require human review before deploying runtime improvement proposals.
- Run every runtime improvement through SokoBench or equivalent commerce evaluations.
- Preserve audit traces for learning-derived changes.
- Keep generated skills versioned, testable, reversible, and permissioned.

## Future Deliverables

- Trace capture schema for prompts, plans, tool calls, latency, errors, corrections, and business outcomes.
- Unified memory engine for shop, customer, supplier, market, and runtime memories.
- Outcome classifier for success, failure, and partial success.
- Pattern discovery process for repeated successful and failed workflows.
- Skill promotion workflow with tests, metadata, versioning, and rollback.
- SokoBench commerce benchmark for runtime changes.
- Human review queue for improvement proposals.
- Production intelligence dashboard for clustered failures, successes, and candidate fixes.

## Phased Roadmap

1. Trace collection.
2. Unified memory engine.
3. Automatic skill extraction.
4. SokoBench.
5. Runtime self-improvement assistant.
6. Marketplace-wide learning.

## Exit Criteria

CP19 can be considered complete when:

- runtime traces are captured without leaking tenant data
- memory promotion rules are implemented and audited
- skill candidates can be generated from repeated successful workflows
- promoted skills are tested, versioned, and reversible
- SokoBench blocks unsafe runtime changes
- human review is required before production deployment
- participating stores benefit from approved improvements without exposing private data

## Rollback

If CP19 must be rolled back, disable learning-derived runtime changes and revert to the prior deterministic runtime configuration. Preserve captured traces in read-only storage until retention, privacy, and deletion policies are applied.
