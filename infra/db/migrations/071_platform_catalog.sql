-- Moves the model and built-in agent catalogs from hardcoded application arrays
-- (aiModelRegistry in services/api/src/cp2/domains/agent-runtime/model-catalog.ts,
-- defaultAgentDefinition in packages/shared-types/src/index.ts) to DB-hosted, operator-editable
-- rows. Every device already reads the effective catalog through the existing API (GET
-- /v1/ai-models and equivalent); this migration makes the API's answer come from these tables
-- instead of a value baked into the deployed build, so adding/editing/disabling a catalog entry no
-- longer requires a code change and redeploy. Inference continues to run through the existing API
-- backend exactly as before - this only changes where the list of available agents/models lives,
-- never how or where inference executes.

-- entity_id/business_id/account_id/user_id/parent_id/record/updated_at is the standard shape every
-- table in normalizedCollections (services/api/src/cp2/postgres-store.ts) must have: the generic
-- snapshot loader/writer reads and writes exactly these seven columns for every registered
-- collection, regardless of whether a given table actually needs the scoping columns. These three
-- tables are global (not shop-scoped), so business_id/account_id/user_id/parent_id stay null except
-- where noted below - not extra columns, but the fixed contract the generic persistence path
-- requires.

-- A platform operator is a deployment operator (e.g. Julien), not a shop owner/staff role - every
-- existing authorization check in this codebase is scoped to a specific business (see

-- in this table is the only source of that authority and is never grantable through any API route;
-- see services/api/scripts/grant-platform-operator.mjs, which is the only writer. entity_id and
-- account_id are both the granted account's id, so an operator grant is found through either the
-- generic entity_id lookup or an accountId-scoped query.

-- authoritative. Provider-gated availability (the two openai-* entries) is computed at read time
-- from deployment env vars (computeModelAvailability) and combined with the stored flag - the
-- seeded `available: true` preserves today's behavior while still letting an operator disable one.
