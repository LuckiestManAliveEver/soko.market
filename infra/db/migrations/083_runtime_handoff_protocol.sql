-- Runtime Handoff Protocol.
--
-- Soko's native runtime graph (063_native_runtime_bindings.sql onward) resolves *which* agent,
-- model, and execution host a conversation uses. It has never represented the task's in-flight
-- execution state independently of that binding, so swapping the agent, model, or host had no
-- portable checkpoint for the new runtime to resume from. This migration adds that checkpoint.
--
-- Soko has no separate `tasks` entity distinct from `conversations` - a conversation *is* the
-- unit of runtime execution here (see docs/architecture/native-runtime-bindings.md). So
-- `task_id` below is populated with the owning conversation's id; the column is still named and
-- exposed as `taskId` throughout the application layer for fidelity with the wider protocol
-- vocabulary (and so a future split of "task" from "conversation" - e.g. multiple concurrent
-- tasks per conversation - only has to add a real tasks table, not rename anything). See
-- docs/architecture/runtime-handoff-protocol.md.
--
-- Every table here follows the repository's existing CP2 generic-entity shape (entity_id,
-- business_id, account_id, user_id, parent_id, record jsonb, updated_at - see
-- 011_cp2_normalized_store.sql) with generated columns and constraints layered on top for
-- referential integrity and fast lookups, exactly like 063_native_runtime_bindings.sql already
-- does for the native runtime graph. entity_id values are application-generated UUIDs
-- (node:crypto randomUUID, the convention used everywhere else in this codebase) rather than a
-- `gen_ulid()` SQL default, since no such function exists in this database.
--
-- Referenced entity types differ from the protocol's reference schema to match what this
-- repository actually has:
--   agents           -> cp2_native_runtime_agents
--   models           -> cp2_native_runtime_models
--   execution hosts  -> cp2_native_execution_hosts
--   runtime instance -> cp2_runtime_task_instances (new - see below; cp2_runtime_sessions is a
--                        distinct, business/user-scoped agentic-planner concept and is not the
--                        per-task "currently executing process" this protocol needs, so it is
--                        deliberately left alone rather than overloaded)
--
-- `conversations`/`cp2_conversations` are not given a real foreign key from the generated
-- `task_id`/`conversation_id` columns below: `conversations.id` is `uuid` while every CP2 record
-- column (including this one) is `text`, and the rest of this codebase never crosses that type
-- boundary with a physical FK (native-runtime tables do the same thing for `runtime_binding_id`
-- in the other direction). Existence is validated in the application layer, exactly like
-- `NativeRuntimeBindingStore.resolveRuntimeBinding` already validates `conversationId` against
-- the in-memory conversations map.
