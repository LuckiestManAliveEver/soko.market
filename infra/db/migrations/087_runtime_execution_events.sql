-- Durable execution event log (docs/architecture/durable-execution-plane.md,
-- docs/architecture/durable-execution-audit.md section 9.1).
--
-- Runtime Handoff Protocol (083_runtime_handoff_protocol.sql onward) already gives Soko an
-- immutable checkpoint chain (cp2_runtime_handoffs) and mutable transfer progress
-- (cp2_runtime_transfers). Neither is a fine-grained, append-only, sequence-numbered record of
-- *what happened* during one task's execution (binding resolution, authorization, context
-- resolution, each model/tool invocation) - that is what this table adds, purely additive, next to
-- the existing protocol tables. It never replaces the checkpoint chain and is never itself used to
-- resume execution (RuntimeCheckpoint/RuntimeHandoff rows remain the only resumable snapshot); this
-- table is for recovery diagnosis, audit, and handoff validation only, per the spec's own framing.
--
-- Same generic-entity shape as every other CP2 table (011_cp2_normalized_store.sql), same
-- generated-column pattern as 083_runtime_handoff_protocol.sql. entity_id is an
-- application-generated UUID, matching every other table in this family.
--
-- taskId is a conversation id (see runtime-handoff.ts's own note on task/conversation identity);
-- no physical FK to cp2_conversations for the same reason cp2_runtime_handoffs has none (uuid vs
-- text column types never cross a physical FK boundary in this codebase - see that migration's
-- header note). executionId is an opaque per-attempt identifier (either a runtime-turn id, or the
-- executionId minted on cp2_runtime_task_instances by a rebind/resume/transfer-completion - see
-- the RuntimeHandoffDomain changes in this same change) - deliberately not a foreign key into any
-- single table, since "an execution attempt" spans both a runtime turn and a task-instance rebind.

-- The hot read path (GET /v1/runtime/:taskId/events, and inspect()) always wants one task's

-- second index is needed here - documented for clarity only.
