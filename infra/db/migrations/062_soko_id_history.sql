-- Canonical store slug system (docs/architecture/soko-id-slug-system.md). Purely additive: one
-- new table, no changes to any existing table (cp2_businesses.sokoId already exists as a jsonb
-- field on the businesses record and needs no schema change - only its generation/rename rules
-- change, in application code). Backed by services/api/src/cp2/store.ts's sokoIdHistory map via
-- postgres-store.ts's existing generic normalizedCollections mechanism, the same pattern
-- cp2_model_preferences (migration 060) already uses - no bespoke SQL beyond this table
-- definition.
