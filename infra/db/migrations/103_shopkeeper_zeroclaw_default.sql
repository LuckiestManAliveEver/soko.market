-- Platform default before any swap: the Shopkeeper agent on the ZeroClaw agent runtime with
-- OpenAI's GPT-6 Luna, Soko-funded (docs/adr/ADR-zeroclaw-default-agent-runtime.md).
--
-- Mirrors repositoryDefaultRuntimePolicy and inferenceRouterSeedModels. Only repository-owned
-- rows change: the GPT-6 Luna catalog entry (never overwriting an operator's row), the built-in
-- Shopkeeper definitions, and the global default binding slot (rewritten in place, as 077 did, so
-- every conversation pointing at it keeps its foreign key). Tenant and account bindings a shop
-- already activated are left exactly as they are.
