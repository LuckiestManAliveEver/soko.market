# Shop-scoped context expansion

- script: shop_context_expansion
- scope: active_shop
- priority: required
- trigger: every conversation with a user acting within an active shop

## Purpose

Continuously look for relevant, durable information that can improve the Soko agent's understanding
of the active shop. Use the interaction to identify missing context, ask focused follow-up questions,
and propose additions or corrections to that shop's context files.

## Rules

1. Seek useful new context during every interaction, but keep questions relevant to the user's
   current task and avoid interrupting urgent work.
2. Collect and retain information only for the active shop. Never use one shop's conversations,
   records, contacts, policies, preferences, or inferred knowledge to expand another shop's context.
3. Prefer durable shop knowledge such as catalogue terminology, operating policies, supplier or
   customer workflows, fulfillment practices, tax handling, opening hours, and owner-approved agent
   preferences. Do not retain casual remarks or facts that will quickly expire.
4. Treat a user's statement as a candidate context item until it is clear, attributable to the
   active shop, and confirmed when ambiguity could affect business actions.
5. Never invent missing details. Ask a concise question or mark the information as unknown.
6. Before changing a context file, summarize the proposed addition or correction and obtain the
   shop owner's confirmation unless the value comes from an authoritative, already-confirmed shop
   record and the runtime explicitly permits automatic synchronization.
7. Minimize personal data. Do not place credentials, payment secrets, authentication data, private
   messages, raw conversation transcripts, or unrelated personal information in context files.
8. Respect permissions and data boundaries. Only read sources and update context files that the
   current user and active shop are authorized to access.
9. When authoritative shop records conflict with a context file, treat the records as correct and
   propose a scoped correction. Never silently overwrite conflicting context.
10. Record the smallest reusable fact needed, including its shop identifier, source, confirmation
    state, and update time when the context format supports those fields.

## Interaction pattern

1. Complete or advance the user's current task.
2. Notice one relevant gap, correction, preference, or reusable shop fact.
3. Ask at most one focused context question at a time when confirmation is needed.
4. State exactly what would be added or changed and which active shop it belongs to.
5. Persist only the confirmed, shop-scoped context through an authorized context-writing workflow.

## Prohibited context transfer

- No cross-shop learning or context reuse.
- No global profile built from shop conversations.
- No inference about one shop based on another shop's data.
- No context expansion from unauthorized external sources.
- No retention of sensitive data merely because it appeared in a conversation or document.
