# Soko conversation-first frontend: architecture and migration roadmap

Status: roadmap adopted and fully implemented — Phases 1-3, 4a-4l (all ShellViews audited), and 5 (architectural enforcement) all shipped
Date: 2026-08-19
Design contract: three mockups reviewed as one product system —
`soko-shell-mockup.html`, `soko-sell-status-mockup.html`,
`soko-buy-unified-cart-mockup.html` (not committed to the repo; treat this
document plus the running Buy/Sell implementation as the durable record of
their content).
Decision: **full shell replacement** — home becomes the session list and
Soko's permanent UI is reduced to
`SokoShell → SessionList → ConversationSession → Composer → GeneratedSurface`,
with every other business view (products, customers, invoices, payments,
suppliers, network, sync, runtime history, imports, logistics, compliance,
beta, launch, reports, notifications) migrated one at a time into
generated-in-conversation surfaces, done incrementally with the existing
view staying live until its replacement genuinely works — never a
big-bang cutover.

## The governing principle

> Conversation is the app. Buy/Sell is a mode, not a page.

Soko is not an e-commerce site with chat added. It is a conversation
runtime in which commerce interfaces are rendered. The mockups' shell
explicitly rejects Catalogue and Orders tabs; the session list is the
entire home screen; everything past it — product cards, confirmations,
status posts, cart, checkout — is tool output the agent places into the
thread, not a hard-coded page.

That distinction is an architectural constraint here, not a styling
decision: **a capability's primary frontend representation is a
generated conversation surface, not a permanent page**, unless a concrete
reason says otherwise (see "When a permanent page is still correct"
below).

## Audit: what already matches the mockups

This is the most important finding of the audit. A large fraction of the
Buy/Sell mockups' content already exists in the repository, built during
earlier work on the same underlying product vision, before these specific
HTML files were reviewed together as a system. Nothing here needed to be
invented from scratch.

### Sell flow (`soko-sell-status-mockup.html`) — already built

| Mockup step                         | Existing implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Attach photo                        | Existing product-capture upload pipeline (reused, not duplicated)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Vision detects items, pins on photo | `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts` `ProductCaptureItemSummary.boundingBox` (normalized `{x,y,width,height}` in `[0,1]`, exactly the mockup's coordinate convention). `detectionAvailable` is honestly `false` today — no real vision model is wired in — and the frontend renders that fact ("Detection isn't available yet — review manually") rather than fabricating pins, per `apps/web/src/ProductCaptureItemsCard.tsx:103-107`. |
| Seller reviews/edits per item       | `ProductCaptureItemsCard.tsx` — confirm/reject per item through `/product-captures/.../items/.../confirm`, never a direct catalogue write                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Contact picker, never select-all    | `apps/web/src/StatusBroadcastComposer.tsx:28-36` — explicit comment: "Never default to select-all: only pre-check contacts who are both a matched Soko account and an existing customer of this business"                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Status posted, tracked              | `apps/web/src/StatusBroadcastCard.tsx` + `StatusBroadcastSummary` (`viewCount`/`replyCount`/`resultingOrderIds`) — a real trackable object, not a plain message                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

One deliberate deviation from the mockup: its step-3 contact list checks
Pastor Njoroge (labeled "In phonebook", not "Regular customer") by
default, which is inconsistent with its own "contacts-only by default,
trust model" note. The existing, already-tested backend rule
(`defaultSelected` only when `isExistingCustomer && isSokoUser`) is more
precisely specified and is what the implementation follows — the mockup's
example checkbox state was not copied literally.

### Buy flow (`soko-buy-unified-cart-mockup.html`) — already built

| Mockup step                                                   | Existing implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One query, fan-out, no source picked first                    | `services/api/src/cp2/domains/commerce/store.ts:933-997` `searchBuyFeed` — merges `listPublicStorefronts` and `listStatusBroadcastsReceivedByViewer` server-side                                                                                          |
| Contacts rank above marketplace at comparable price/relevance | Same function, line 989: `buyTextRelevanceScore(...) + (sourceKind === "contact" ? 50 : 0)` — a flat bonus, not unconditional priority; a much stronger catalogue match still outranks a barely-relevant contact result                                   |
| Marketplace connectors                                        | `BuyResultSourceKind = "contact" \| "catalogue" \| "marketplace_connector"` exists in the type system; `marketplaceConnectorAvailable` is always `false` — never fabricated (matches `ProductCaptureItemSummary.detectionAvailable`'s honesty convention) |
| Distinct result rendering by source                           | `apps/web/src/StatusResultCard.tsx` — `buy-source-badge buy-source-${sourceKind}`                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Cart grouped, not merged                                      | `apps/web/src/UnifiedCartSummary.tsx` — grouped by `${sourceKind}:${sourceId}`, one combined total, source label per group                                                                                                                                |
| Checkout: one action, N fulfilment handoffs                   | `services/api/src/cp2/domains/commerce/store.ts:999-1112` `createUnifiedCheckout` — one order per distinct source (draft invoice per business, no-invoice peer order per contact status); failures surfaced, never silently dropped                       |
| Order tracking shows the split                                | `apps/web/src/FulfilmentSplitCard.tsx` — "N contact pickups + M shop orders," independent status per handoff                                                                                                                                              |
| Settlement decision                                           | Recorded explicitly in `documentation/COMMERCE_SETTLEMENT_DECISION.md` — no payment capture today (no live rail exists), recommended direction for when one does                                                                                          |

Both flows are wired into the live conversation renderer already —
`apps/web/src/ChatSurface.tsx:781-804` renders `ProductCaptureItemsCard`
/ `StatusBroadcastCard` / `FulfilmentSplitCard` per-message off structured
metadata, lazy-loaded, not as separate app sections.

### Generated surface protocol — already correctly typed at the wire level, not at the render level

`ConversationMessageContent` (`packages/shared-types/src/index.ts:445-460`)
is already a proper discriminated union by `type`: `text`, `product-card`,
`encrypted`, `storefront`, `owner-controls`, `confirmation`,
`product-capture-progress`, `status-broadcast`, `unified-checkout`. The
server constructs these; nothing renders raw model HTML or executes
model-generated code anywhere in the repository.

The gap was entirely on the frontend rendering path. `mapConversationMessage`
(`apps/web/src/chat-message-plumbing.ts:48-108`) already switches on
`message.content.type` correctly, but then **flattens** each variant into
a growing bag of optional fields on the frontend's own `ChatMessage` type
(`businessCards`, `productCaptureJobId`, `statusBroadcastId`,
`unifiedCheckoutId`, ...), and `ChatSurface.tsx` checked each field with
its own `message.field !== undefined ? <SpecificCard /> : null` block.
Every new surface type meant one more optional field plus one more
if-block, growing without bound — exactly the anti-pattern Stage 4 of the
design brief calls out, just arrived at through field-flattening rather
than phrase-matching. **This is fixed in Phase 1, below.**

### Buy/Sell mode — genuinely not per-session yet, and non-trivial to make so

This is the one place where the mockups describe something the repository
does not yet have, and where "just move a variable" would be wrong.

- `apps/web/src/hooks/useNavigationState.ts` holds `mode: SokoMode`
  (`"marketplace" | "seller"`) as a single piece of state for the whole
  app — not a property of any individual conversation.
- The server has an equivalent concept, `SokoSessionContext`
  (`packages/shared-types/src/index.ts:1108-1133`), but it is stored
  **one row per account** (`services/api/src/cp2/store.ts:6060-6093`,
  keyed by `session.account.id`, not by conversation), and it already
  gates real authorization: `createConversationMessage` throws
  `seller_context_required` when `context.mode !== "seller"` for an
  owner-controls message (`services/api/src/cp2/domains/messaging/store.ts:2442-2448`).
  Moving `mode` to be per-conversation is therefore not a pure frontend
  change — it changes an authorization input.
- Conversations are already genuinely multi-instance per account (the
  inbox lists `personal` / `storefront` / `order` conversations), but the
  owner's own agent chat is a **singleton**:
  `ensurePersonalAccountConversation` (`services/api/src/cp2/domains/messaging/store.ts:3512-3533`)
  finds or creates exactly one `kind: "personal", activeShopId: null`
  conversation per account. The mockup's session list shows several
  independently-titled owner-agent sessions ("Restock maize", "Chicken
  feed", "School laptop") each with their own mode — today's data model
  supports exactly one.

Making Buy/Sell genuinely per-session therefore requires, in order:
(1) allowing an account to have more than one personal agent conversation,
(2) moving mode (and the authorization check that reads it) from
account-scoped to conversation-scoped, (3) the frontend session-list UI
that lets a user create/open/rename these. This is sequenced as Phase 3
below, after the safer, purely-additive Phase 1 and Phase 2 work, and it
gets a dedicated audit of every `context.mode` read site before any code
changes, per the same discipline used everywhere else in this codebase's
modularization work — trace every call site, don't guess.

## Per-conversation session context (Phase 2 — implemented)

Full audit before any change, then the smallest data-model change that
makes (2) above true without requiring (1) or (3) yet — Phase 2's own
stated scope ("land it behind the existing conversation/session
infrastructure without changing today's single-session behavior yet").

**What the audit found:**

- `getSokoSessionContext`/`updateSokoSessionContext`
  (`services/api/src/cp2/store.ts`) gate three separate authorization
  invariants on `mode`/`activeShopId`/`activeSurface`: the
  `seller_context_required` check on `owner-controls` messages
  (`domains/messaging/store.ts:2442`), `active_shop_required` (seller mode
  needs an active shop), and `surface_mode_invalid` (`sellerOnlySurfaces =
  new Set(["catalogue", "owner-controls", "receipt"])`, `store.ts:275`,
  only reachable in seller mode). None of the three cared how the context
  row was keyed — they only ever read fields off whatever
  `StoredSokoSessionContext` they were handed.
- `updateSokoSessionContext` already accepted a `conversationId` input
  before this change, but only used it to validate membership and to
  overwrite the single row's `conversationId` field — not to select which
  row to operate on. There was exactly one row per account, full stop.
- Context bootstrap was duplicated verbatim in two places: account/session
  creation (`store.ts`, inside `createSession`) and the lazy
  `ensureSokoSessionContext`. Both built the same default-shape object.
  Collapsed into one `buildDefaultSessionContext` helper as part of this
  change — a correctness-neutral cleanup the audit surfaced, not a
  Phase 2 goal in itself.
- The frontend (`apps/web/src/hooks/useAuthState.ts`) genuinely keeps
  `mode`/`view`/`activeConversationId` synced with the backend context
  today, bidirectionally: `loadSokoSessionContext` restores frontend state
  from `/v1/session/context` on every login, and a debounced 250ms effect
  in `SokoApplication.tsx` (~line 847) `PATCH`es the backend whenever
  frontend mode/shop/surface/conversation drift from the last-known
  server value — already sending its current `activeConversationId` on
  every patch. This is why Phase 2 could ship as a pure backend change:
  the frontend was already conversation-aware, it just had only one
  conversation to be aware of.
- Persistence is a JSON-blob mirror (`cp2_session_contexts` table, one row
  per snapshot-array entry, upserted by `entity_id`), not a structured
  SQL table — the Drizzle-schema `soko_session_contexts` table (with its
  own migration history, including 052's deliberate collapse from
  `session_id`-per-row to `account_id`-per-row) is a separate, write-never
  table that only the GDPR purge query touches. No DDL migration was
  needed: the composite key lives entirely in application code
  (`sessionContextKey(accountId, conversationId)` and the
  `recordEntityId` mapping in `postgres-store.ts`), and the periodic
  full-snapshot writer (`saveCollectionRecords`) self-heals any row left
  over from the pre-Phase-2 `entity_id = accountId` scheme on its next
  write, since that row no longer matches any `desiredId`.

**What changed:**

- `sessionContexts` (`store.ts`) is now keyed by
  `sessionContextKey(accountId, conversationId) = "${accountId}:${conversationId}"`,
  not `accountId` alone. `ensureSokoSessionContext` takes an optional
  `conversationId`; omitted, it resolves to the account's personal
  conversation exactly as before (so every existing caller is unchanged).
  Passed, it resolves and validates that conversation
  (`requireAccountConversation`) and returns/creates *that conversation's
  own* context row, defaulting fresh (`mode: "marketplace"`, `activeSurface:
  "conversation"`) rather than inheriting the account's other contexts.
- `GET /v1/session/context` accepts an optional `?conversationId=` query
  param. `PATCH /v1/session/context`'s existing `conversationId` body
  field now selects the target row instead of only repointing the single
  row's `conversationId` field.
- The three authorization checks are untouched — they already worked
  against whichever context object they were handed.
- Today's behavior is unchanged: `ensurePersonalAccountConversation` still
  returns the same one conversation per account (Phase 3 hasn't shipped
  multi-session creation yet), so every account still has exactly one
  context row in practice. The change is structural readiness, not a
  behavior flip.
- Regression test:
  `tests/cp20-unified-session-conversations.test.ts` — "gives each
  conversation its own session context row instead of one shared
  account-wide row" creates a second (storefront) conversation the same
  account already participates in, sets a different mode/surface on it via
  `?conversationId=`, and asserts the account's personal conversation's
  context is untouched and `store.snapshot().sessionContexts` now holds
  two independent rows. Verified to fail against the pre-Phase-2 code
  (stashed the implementation, kept the test, confirmed a real
  `AssertionError`) before restoring the fix.

**What Phase 3 still needs**, now that the data model is ready: a way to
create a *second* personal agent conversation for an account (today only
`ensurePersonalAccountConversation`'s singleton exists), and the
session-list UI itself.

### The 15 conventional top-level views

`apps/web/src/app-shell.ts`'s `ShellView` union has 17 entries: `home`,
`chat`, and 15 business views (`products`, `suppliers`, `customers`,
`invoices`, `network`, `sync`, `runtime`, `payments`, `imports`,
`logistics`, `compliance`, `beta`, `launch`, `reports`, `notifications`).
`SokoApplication.tsx`'s `renderActiveWorkspace()` is a single switch
statement rendering one `*Surface` component per view.

The good news for migration risk: every one of these 15 views is already
a clean, self-contained, prop-driven component
(`ProductSurface`, `CustomerSurface`, `InvoiceSurface`, ...), each backed
by its own already-extracted domain hook (`useProductsState`,
`useCustomersState`, `useInvoicesState`, `usePaymentsState`,
`useSuppliersState`, `useNetworkState`, `useSyncState`,
`useRuntimeHistoryState`, `useImportsState`, `useLogisticsState`,
`useReadinessState` for compliance/beta/launch, `useReportsState`,
`useStorefrontCareState`/`useNotificationsState`) from the earlier
OwnerApp state-decomposition effort. None of these components are
entangled with routing. Migrating a view to a generated surface is a
presentation-layer change — reuse the existing Surface component and its
hook unchanged, change how it is _reached_ (a conversation action instead
of permanent top-level navigation), not a business-logic rewrite.

## Multi-session UI (Phase 3 — implemented)

The audit for this phase found the roadmap's own stated blocker
("(1) allowing an account to have more than one personal agent
conversation") was already false: `POST /v1/conversations`'s
`createConversation` always calls `createAccountConversation`, which
mints a fresh `randomUUID()` conversation unconditionally — it was never
a find-or-create. The singleton behavior the earlier audit found belongs
only to `ensurePersonalAccountConversation` (the login-time bootstrap
path). So `{ kind: "personal", activeShopId: null }` with no `recipient`
already created a genuinely new, independent agent session; nothing in
the repo just called it more than once. Phase 3 turned out to be wiring
existing primitives together on the frontend, not new backend capacity.

**The one real gap**: `ConversationInboxItem` (used for both the home
session list and the general chat inbox) could not distinguish "my own
agent session" from "a direct message with another human" — both are
`kind: "personal"` with `activeShopId: null`. Added `hasHumanRecipient:
boolean` to the type, computed server-side in `listConversations`
(`services/api/src/cp2/domains/messaging/store.ts`) from a small
extracted helper, `conversationHasHumanRecipient`, that also replaced an
inline duplicate of the same check already used by
`attemptPublicAgentReply`'s `agent_processing_requires_agent_conversation`
guard.

**What changed:**

- `apps/web/src/ChatSurface.tsx` — `home` now filters `conversations` to
  `kind === "personal" && !hasHumanRecipient` (the account's own agent
  sessions); `chat` is untouched and still shows the full inbox
  (DMs/storefront/order included), so nothing about today's messaging
  behavior regresses. `home`'s heading reads "Sessions" with a "New
  session" action (an inline name form, mirroring the existing "New
  conversation" form's shape) instead of the DM-creation flow.
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useChatInboxState.ts` — `createAgentSession(title?)`
  posts a fresh `{ kind: "personal", activeShopId: null }` conversation
  and switches to it via `selectConversation`.
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useAuthState.ts` — added
  `applySessionContextForConversation(conversationId)`, the per-session
  sibling of `loadSokoSessionContext`: fetches
  `/v1/session/context?conversationId=` (Phase 2) and applies that
  conversation's own `mode` instead of the account-wide default.
  `selectConversation` now calls this on every switch, so **Buy/Sell mode
  is genuinely per-session** — switching to a different agent session
  restores that session's own mode instead of carrying over whatever mode
  the previous session was in. The existing debounced sync effect in
  `SokoApplication.tsx` (Phase 2) already sent the active
  `conversationId` on every patch, so the write side needed no change —
  only the read side (switching sessions) was missing this.
- `useAuthState`'s hook call moved earlier in `SokoApplication.tsx` (right
  after `useChatThreadState`, before `useChatInboxState`), since
  `useChatInboxState` now needs `applySessionContextForConversation` at
  call time. Verified none of `useAuthState`'s own inputs depend on
  anything `useChatThreadState`/`useChatInboxState` produce before
  moving it.

**What Phase 3 deliberately left alone**: `activeShopId` does not travel
with a session switch. An account can only ever hold one shop (creating a
second returns `store_already_registered`), so there is no second
business to switch *to* yet — this becomes relevant only once Phase 3's
own non-goal (multiple shops per account) is ever revisited, which it
is not here.

Regression tests: `tests/session-list-home.test.ts` (frontend wiring,
source-text) and `tests/cp20-unified-session-conversations.test.ts`
("lets an account hold several independent agent sessions, distinct from
direct messages" — creates two sessions plus one DM, asserts
`hasHumanRecipient` correctly separates them for both participants).
Verified to fail against the pre-Phase-3 code (stashed the
implementation, kept the tests, confirmed real failures) before
restoring the fix.

## Products chat-invokable capability (Phase 4a — implemented)

The first of the 15 per-`ShellView` migration phases. The initial audit
(see "the audit found" in this section) discovered the real scope was far
bigger than "add a card" — closer to a new feature than a refactor. The
user was asked to confirm the calibration before building
(AskUserQuestion, per the Confusion Protocol) and chose the full literal
spec, one domain at a time.

**What the audit found:**

- Two of the four product runtime tools were execution stubs:
  `product.update`/`product.stock_adjust` in `executeRuntimeAction`
  (`services/api/src/cp2/domains/agent-runtime/store.ts`) returned `null`
  unconditionally, regardless of what a valid proposal contained.
- No intent for "edit a product" or "adjust stock" existed in the
  *primary* free-text parser (`RuleIntent`, `packages/tool-core/src/index.ts`)
  — only `add_product`/`show_products`/etc.
- A second, separate vocabulary matcher already existed
  (`ProductContextScriptMatch`/`createRuntimeToolProposalFromProductContextScript`,
  bilingual EN/SW phrase lists) with `PRODUCT_EDIT`/`PRODUCT_STOCK_ADJUST`
  cases already defined — but both were hard-coded to always return
  `invalid(...)`, meaning even a fully-specified message could never
  produce an executable proposal through it.
- **Critical finding from the first draft of this phase**: the initial
  implementation fixed the *primary* parser
  (`parseMerchantCommand`/`createRuntimeToolProposal`) and shipped a
  regression test using `parseMerchantCommand` directly - it passed. A
  second, end-to-end test hitting the real
  `POST /businesses/:id/runtime/turns` route failed: `createRuntimeTurn`
  (`agent-runtime/store.ts` ~line 2756-2767) tries the **context-script
  matcher first** and only falls back to `parseMerchantCommand` when it
  doesn't match — and "add product X" always matches the context-script's
  own `PRODUCT_ADD` phrase list. The primary-parser fix was real but
  dead code for this exact case; the actual default path needed the same
  fix applied to `extractProductContextEntities`/
  `createRuntimeToolProposalFromProductContextScript` instead. Caught only
  because the regression test exercised the real HTTP route instead of
  the parser function directly — the harsh-critic discipline this session
  runs on ("re-break the fix, verify against the real path") working
  exactly as intended.
- A currency-tagged number ("ksh 150") was being read as **both** a
  quantity and a price by both parsers' shared bare-number regex — a
  second bug the end-to-end test caught before it shipped. Fixed by
  extracting the currency-tagged span first and excluding it from the
  generic quantity match in both places.

**What changed:**

- Both parsers now support `update_product`/`adjust_stock` intents
  (primary parser: new `intentRules` entries, `extractSlots` extraction,
  `getMissingSlotQuestion` clarification; context-script matcher:
  `PRODUCT_EDIT`/`PRODUCT_UPDATE`/`PRODUCT_STOCK_ADJUST` cases now
  produce `valid()` proposals when their required fields are present,
  instead of always asking a question).
- `product.create` on both paths now carries an optional `sellingPrice`
  when the message includes a currency-tagged number.
- `executeRuntimeAction` implements `product.update`/`product.stock_adjust`
  for real: resolves the named product, applies only the fields the
  message specified (falling back to the existing value for anything
  unmentioned), and calls the sales domain's existing
  `updateProduct`/`adjustProductStock` methods (newly wired into the
  agent-runtime domain's `deps`).
- A new self-contained `ProductManagementCard` (mirrors
  `ProductCaptureItemsCard`'s shape — fetches its own data from
  `businessId` alone, not `useProductsState`/`ProductSurface`, which need
  8 injected deps tied to sibling hooks in `SokoApplication.tsx`) is
  posted into the owner's own conversation
  (`useChatRuntimeState.ts`'s `applyRuntimeResult`, after any successful
  `product.create`/`product.update`/`product.stock_adjust` runtime turn)
  via a new `"product-management"` `ConversationMessageContent` variant,
  registered in `generated-surface-registry.tsx` the same way as the
  other three card types.

**What Phase 4a deliberately left alone**: the permanent `products`
`ShellView`/nav entry is **not removed**. The roadmap's own rule is
"legacy pages are removed only after their generated-surface replacement
is proven working — never a big-bang cutover," and this environment has
no browser automation available to prove it live. The chat-invokable path
is additive: an owner can now also manage products entirely through
chat, but the Products page keeps working exactly as before for
everyone who doesn't use it that way yet.

Regression tests: `tests/cp4-rule-parser.test.ts` (new intents, and the
currency/quantity double-counting fix), `tests/cp10-sokoclaw-runtime.test.ts`
("creates, edits, and adjusts stock for a product through confirmed
runtime turns" — a full propose→confirm cycle against the real HTTP
route, the test that caught both bugs above), `tests/product-management-card.test.ts`
(frontend wiring, source-text). Verified to fail against the
pre-Phase-4a code (stashed the implementation, kept the tests, confirmed
real failures) before restoring the fix.

## Suppliers chat-invokable capability (Phase 4b — implemented)

Same pattern as 4a, applied to suppliers — with a genuinely new failure
mode Phase 4a hadn't surfaced yet.

**What the audit found:**

- No supplier runtime tools existed at all (`RuntimeToolName` had zero
  `supplier.*` entries) — a bigger gap than products, which at least had
  two of four tools working. Added `supplier.create`/`supplier.update`
  (`supplier.delete` deliberately left off the chat-invokable surface,
  matching the existing `product.delete` precedent of requiring a more
  deliberate trigger than loose free-text scoring — see "What Phase 4a
  deliberately left alone").
- Suppliers have no context-script vocabulary of their own (that matcher
  is product-only, `scriptId: "product-vocabulary"`), so the primary
  parser (`parseMerchantCommand`) is the *only* path — no dual-parser
  sync risk like 4a's.
- **The real catch, found by writing the end-to-end test before trusting
  the parser in isolation (same discipline that caught 4a's bugs)**: the
  product vocabulary's built-in phrase list includes a *bare* `"edit"`
  and `"badilisha"` entry for `PRODUCT_EDIT` — matching on the verb alone,
  with no requirement that a product noun also be present. `"edit
  supplier John Doe 0798765432"` matched `PRODUCT_EDIT` before it ever
  reached the primary parser, with `"supplier john doe"` misread as a
  product name. This is a pre-existing looseness in the product
  vocabulary (several other intents have similarly bare single-word
  phrases — `PRODUCT_LIST` matches on bare `"stock"`/`"product"`/etc. too)
  that was latent and harmless until a second domain started using
  overlapping verbs. Rewriting the whole vocabulary's specificity was out
  of scope for this phase; instead `parseProductContextScriptCommand`
  gained a narrow guard — a message naming another domain noun
  (`supplier`/`msambazaji`) skips product-vocabulary matching entirely
  and falls through to the primary parser, which owns `update_supplier`.
- Reused Phase 4a's currency/quantity double-counting fix pattern for
  phone numbers: `"0712345678"` in a message must not also be read as a
  quantity. `extractSlots` now extracts a phone-shaped run of 7+ digits
  before the generic quantity match, the same way it already excludes a
  currency-tagged price.

**What changed:** `supplier.create`/`supplier.update` tool definitions,
new `add_supplier`/`update_supplier` primary-parser intents (EN/SW), the
product-vocabulary exclusion guard above, `executeRuntimeAction` cases
resolving the named supplier and calling the sales domain's existing
`createSupplier`/`updateSupplier`, a new self-contained
`SupplierManagementCard` (mirrors `ProductManagementCard` — fetches its
own data from `businessId`, not `useSuppliersState`, which needs
`loadReports`/`registerReset`/`registerRefresh` tied to sibling hooks),
registered under a new `"supplier-management"` content type. Permanent
`suppliers` nav entry kept, same reasoning as 4a.

Regression tests: `tests/cp4-rule-parser.test.ts` (new intents, and the
`parseProductContextScriptCommand` exclusion guard — asserts `"edit
supplier..."` returns `null` from the product matcher), `tests/cp10-sokoclaw-runtime.test.ts`
("creates and edits a supplier through confirmed runtime turns, not the
product vocabulary" — asserts zero products exist after the run, the
guard against the exact regression this phase found), `tests/supplier-management-card.test.ts`
(frontend wiring). Verified to fail against the pre-Phase-4b code before
restoring the fix.

## Customers chat-invokable capability (Phase 4c — implemented)

Same pattern as 4b, applied to customers — this time reusing 4b's own
infrastructure directly rather than rediscovering it.

**What the audit found:**

- `customer.create` already existed and was fully wired (unlike
  suppliers' complete absence) — but hard-coded `phone`/`email`/`notes`
  to `null` regardless of what the message said, the same class of gap
  Phase 4a fixed for product price. No `customer.update` tool existed.
- The product-vocabulary exclusion guard added in Phase 4b
  (`parseProductContextScriptCommand` skipping product matching when the
  message names another domain noun) already had the right shape to
  extend — added `customer`/`customers`/`client`/`clients`/`mteja`/`wateja`
  to the same guard rather than writing a second, parallel mechanism.
  Verified empirically (not assumed) that `"edit customer Mary Wanjiru
  0700111222"` collided with `PRODUCT_EDIT`'s bare `"edit"` phrase before
  the guard, exactly like the supplier case.
- Reused 4b's phone-extraction fix in `extractSlots` as-is — no new work
  needed, since it was already unconditional (not gated to a specific
  intent), so `add_customer`/`update_customer` picked it up automatically
  once `createRuntimeToolProposal` started reading `slots.phone`.

**What changed:** `customer.update` tool definition, `update_customer`
primary-parser intent, `executeRuntimeAction`'s `customer.create` case
now carries `phone` (previously always `null`) and a new `customer.update`
case resolving the named customer and calling the sales domain's existing
`updateCustomer`. A new `CustomerManagementCard` (no delete action - no
`deleteCustomer` endpoint exists in this codebase at all, confirmed by
checking rather than assuming, so the card only offers what the REST
contract actually supports), registered under `"customer-management"`.

Regression tests: `tests/cp4-rule-parser.test.ts`, `tests/cp10-sokoclaw-runtime.test.ts`
("creates and edits a customer through confirmed runtime turns, not the
product vocabulary"), `tests/customer-management-card.test.ts`. Verified
to fail against the pre-Phase-4c code before restoring the fix.

## Invoices chat-invokable capability (Phase 4d — implemented)

A genuinely different shape from 4a-4c, found during the audit rather
than assumed going in.

**What the audit found:**

- `invoice.draft`'s tool proposal has always been hard-coded
  `invalid("Invoice runtime draft needs product and price details.")` -
  unconditionally, regardless of what the message says - and
  `executeRuntimeAction`'s `invoice.draft` case has always been a stub
  returning `null`. Both are original design decisions, not bugs: an
  invoice needs a resolved product, a quantity, and a unit price, and the
  primary parser's `create_invoice` slot extraction has only ever
  captured `customerName` (no product-name extraction exists for
  invoices at all). Getting all of that right from one free-text message
  is a materially harder extraction problem than 4a-4c's single-field
  create/update commands - "2 sugar at 150" requires resolving "sugar" to
  a real product AND disambiguating which number is quantity versus
  price, for a record that moves stock and money once confirmed.
- The frontend itself only ever composes **one line item per invoice
  draft** (`useInvoicesState.ts`'s `createInvoicePayload()` sends a
  single-item array, even though the backend's `InvoiceInput.items`
  accepts multiple) - so matching the permanent page's own scope, not
  exceeding it, an interactive single-item composer is the right shape,
  not a gap.

**The scope decision this phase made**: rather than building a fragile
multi-slot extractor to parse product+quantity+price from text (real NLU
work, not "smallest correct"), the chat trigger reacts to the *existing*
`create_invoice` classification - unconditionally, not gated on tool
execution succeeding (`invoice.draft` never executes for real) - and
opens an interactive `InvoiceManagementCard` pre-filled with whatever
customer name the message named. The owner picks the product from a
dropdown and enters quantity/price there, then the card calls the same
`POST /businesses/:id/invoices` and `.../confirm` endpoints the permanent
page already uses. **No backend parser or execution code changed in this
phase** - `create_invoice`/`invoice.draft`'s existing shape was already
exactly what the new frontend trigger needed; Phase 4d only added the
frontend reaction to a proposal shape that already existed.

Regression tests: `tests/cp10-sokoclaw-runtime.test.ts` ("classifies
create_invoice and surfaces the extracted customer name for the composer
card" - pins the existing backend contract the new frontend code depends
on; passes unchanged with no backend files stashed, confirming this
phase's only new code is frontend), `tests/invoice-management-card.test.ts`
(frontend wiring - verified to fail without the frontend implementation).

## Payments chat-invokable capability (Phase 4e — implemented)

Same shape as 4d, applied to payments — the second, not the first, time
this "composer card instead of NLU extraction" pattern got used, which
is why it took a fraction of the effort.

**What the audit found:** `payment.record`'s proposal has always been
hard-coded `invalid("Payment runtime draft needs an invoice id and
method.")` — a customer can have several open invoices, and free text
cannot reliably say which one a payment applies to. Same underlying
reason as invoices, confirmed rather than assumed by reading the
existing code and reusing the exact `record_payment`/`payment.record`
proposal shape (`customerName`, `amount`) already extracted by the
primary parser.

**What changed:** A `PaymentManagementCard` opens as soon as a message
classifies as `record_payment` (unconditional on tool execution, same as
invoices), pre-filled with the extracted customer name matched against
`GET /businesses/:id/payment-summaries` (invoices with a balance due) —
picking the first unpaid invoice for that customer if one matches, so
the common case (a customer with one open invoice) needs zero extra
clicks. The owner confirms amount and method, then the card calls the
same `POST /businesses/:id/payments` endpoint the permanent page uses.
No backend parser or execution code changed — extended the *existing*
`record_payment` test to also pin `plan.input` (customerName, amount) as
the contract the new frontend code depends on, rather than adding a
parallel test.

Regression tests: `tests/cp10-sokoclaw-runtime.test.ts` (extended, not
duplicated), `tests/payment-management-card.test.ts` (frontend wiring —
verified to fail without the frontend implementation).

## Imports chat-invokable capability (Phase 4f — implemented)

A third distinct shape — this domain was already the *most* chat-capable
of any so far, and the audit found the gap was narrower than expected.

**What the audit found:**

- "Imports" (the `imports` `ShellView`, "Purchase receipts" in the nav)
  is bulk CSV/document import of product catalogues or supplier lists —
  a different concept from the per-receipt photo OCR flow that actually
  lives under Suppliers (`uploadSupplierReceipt`/`confirmSupplierReceipt`
  in `useSuppliersState.ts`). Confirmed by reading both hooks rather than
  assuming from the nav label.
- Uploading a document is unavoidably a file action — `receipt.scan` and
  `createDocumentImport` both need actual file bytes, which a chat text
  message cannot carry. This is a genuine, permanent constraint, not a
  gap this phase could close.
- **`document_import.confirm` already resolves and executes for real
  from chat today** — `createRuntimeDocumentImportProposal`
  (`agent-runtime/store.ts`) is a third, separate proposal-generation
  path from `parseMerchantCommand`/the product-vocabulary matcher
  (worth knowing given the two false-positive collisions those found in
  4a/4b), triggered by action+document-reference words. It resolves
  "confirm the import" (or a message referencing a specific job ID) to
  the account's latest previewed job automatically, validates it has
  selected rows, and — once confirmed the same way any other
  high-risk tool is — calls the real `confirmProductImport`/
  `confirmSupplierImport`. This was already a complete, shipped feature,
  confirmed by an existing passing end-to-end test
  (`tests/document-agent-import.e2e.test.ts`), not discovered as new.

**What changed:** the one real gap was reviewing and adjusting row
selection *inline*, instead of requiring a trip to the permanent Imports
page before confirming. A new `ImportManagementCard` opens as soon as a
message classifies as `document_import.confirm`, showing the job's rows
with per-row selection (mirroring `ProductCaptureItemsCard`'s review
pattern), then calls the same confirm endpoint the permanent page uses.
No backend parser or execution code changed — extended the existing
end-to-end test to pin `plan.input.importJobId` as the contract the new
frontend code depends on.

Regression tests: `tests/document-agent-import.e2e.test.ts` (extended),
`tests/import-management-card.test.ts` (frontend wiring — verified to
fail without the frontend implementation).

## Network audit (Phase 4g — no card; one bug fixed)

The first domain where the honest verdict is "mostly stays a permanent
page" — the user explicitly asked for honest per-domain judgment rather
than forcing every domain into the chat-capability pattern, and this is
that judgment applied.

**What the audit found:**

- The domain's highest-value read action — "find suppliers through my
  network" — was **already fully chat-invokable**, via a mechanism none
  of the earlier phases used: `isNetworkDiscoveryRequest`
  (`contacts-import.ts`), a frontend-only phrase match, separate from the
  entire `RuntimeToolName`/`parseMerchantCommand` system this session has
  worked in through Phase 4a-4f. A fourth distinct trigger mechanism in
  this codebase, confirmed by reading it rather than assuming continuity
  with the runtime-tool system.
- The rest of the domain's actions — phone contact picker sync, social
  OAuth network sync, CSV contact import/export — are gated behind
  native browser APIs (`navigator.contacts.select`, OAuth redirects,
  file pickers) that a chat text message cannot replace. This is a
  permanent constraint, the same class of finding as imports' "can't
  upload a file via text," not a gap to close.
- Approving/rejecting a specific agent route needs a route ID a normal
  chat message wouldn't reference, and routes are already visible where
  they're proposed — building a separate chat trigger for "approve that
  route" was judged lower-value than the domain's real gap below, so it
  was not built this phase.

**The one real bug found**: `requestNetworkRoute()` — the function the
existing chat trigger calls — sent a **hard-coded** `requestText: "Find
suppliers through my network"` regardless of what the owner actually
typed, even though the server (`services/api/src/cp2/domains/network/store.ts:910`)
matches `requestText` against network node names to find relevant
suppliers. "Find a supplier for rice through my network" was silently
losing "rice" and searching generically — the same class of bug as
4a's product-price-drop and 4c's customer-phone-drop, just found in a
domain this session judged mostly complete rather than one it built new
capability for. Fixed by threading the real chat message through as
`requestText`, keeping `targetNodeId` as the first parameter (an
existing `SokoApplication.tsx` button already calls
`requestNetworkRoute(targetNodeId)` positionally — reordering would have
silently broken it, caught by checking every call site before changing
the signature, not just the one this phase touched).

**Verdict**: no generated card, no new runtime tool. The domain's
permanent page stays exactly as important as it is today — most of what
it does cannot move to chat, and the one thing that already had before
this fix was quietly broken.

Regression tests: `tests/network-route-request-text.test.ts` (both the
fix and the call-site-safety check — verified to fail against the
pre-fix code before restoring it).

## Logistics chat-invokable capability (Phase 4h — implemented)

Unlike network (4g), logistics was judged genuinely chat-relevant: "mark
delivered", "picked up", "out for delivery" are natural merchant
sentences, and the domain already had a real, fully-working backend
mutation (`updateLogisticsStatus` in
`services/api/src/cp2/domains/logistics/store.ts`) that had simply never
been wired into the runtime-tool system.

**What the audit found:**

- `updateLogisticsStatus` was a complete, non-stub method — validates the
  status transition, requires `logistics:write`, updates
  `completedAt`/`cancelledAt`, records a business event. Nothing backend
  needed building from scratch, only wiring.
- No existing `RuntimeToolName`/`RuleIntent` covered logistics at all —
  the fourth domain this session where "the backend mutation exists but
  the runtime-tool layer never learned about it" (after products,
  suppliers before their fixes, and — differently — imports before 4f).
- Like invoices/payments (4d/4e), "mark delivered" can never be fully
  specified from free text alone: a merchant can have several open
  deliveries, and the message rarely states a status precisely enough to
  trust automatically. Same "composer card, no full auto-execution" shape
  as those two phases, not automatic execution.

**What was built:**

- `packages/tool-core/src/index.ts`: a new `update_logistics` rule
  intent (EN/SW phrases — "mark delivered", "out for delivery", "picked
  up", "imefika", "imetumwa"), a `logistics.update_status` runtime tool
  registered as high-risk/confirmation-required, and a proposal that
  extracts the customer name but stays deliberately invalid (needs which
  delivery and the new status) — mirroring `payment.record`'s shape
  exactly.
- `services/api/src/cp2/domains/agent-runtime/store.ts` +
  `services/api/src/cp2/store.ts`: wired `logistics.update_status`
  execution to the existing `LogisticsDomain.updateLogisticsStatus`, no
  new backend mutation logic.
- `LogisticsManagementCard.tsx`: a new self-contained generated card,
  same shape as `PaymentManagementCard` — fetches the business's open
  deliveries, pre-selects one matching the extracted customer name if
  given, lets the owner pick the delivery and the new status, then
  `PATCH`es the same endpoint the permanent Logistics page already uses
  (`useLogisticsState.ts:updateLogisticsStatus`).
- Registered in `generated-surface-registry.tsx` and
  `soko-application-shared.ts`; the `logistics-management` message-content
  variant added to `ConversationMessageContent` and validated server-side
  in `messaging/shared.ts`; the trigger in `useChatRuntimeState.ts` posts
  the card as soon as a turn classifies as `logistics.update_status`, not
  gated on execution (it never auto-executes from text alone, same as
  invoices/payments).

Regression tests: `tests/cp4-rule-parser.test.ts` (new parser-level
assertion for `update_logistics`, verified against real parser output
first), `tests/cp10-sokoclaw-runtime.test.ts` (new end-to-end test
proving the real HTTP route classifies "mark delivered for Mary" as
`logistics.update_status` and stays a non-executing clarification),
`tests/logistics-management-card.test.ts` (frontend wiring — verified to
fail without the frontend implementation). All three verified to fail
with the Phase 4h implementation files stashed, pass with them restored.

## Sync + Runtime audit (Phases 4i-4j — no card, no bug)

Both domains audited honestly, per the same standing instruction as 4g:
judge each domain on its own merits rather than force it into the
chat-capability pattern. Both verdicts are "stays a permanent page, no
generated card" — but for a stronger reason than network's (4g): neither
domain has *any* natural single-sentence chat phrasing, not even a
partial one.

**Sync** (`useSyncState.ts`) is the offline mutation queue and IndexedDB
catch-up/realtime machinery — `replaySyncQueue`/`replaySyncQueueItem`
retry queued offline writes, `queueMutationAfterNetworkFailure` persists
a mutation locally when a write fails offline. Its only two owner-facing
actions are "replay the sync queue" and "replay one item" — both need a
`syncItemId` a chat message would never carry, and both already have
direct buttons on the permanent Sync page (`SokoApplication.tsx:1613`,
`:1624`, wired directly to the domain hook, not through the runtime-tool
system). No `RuntimeToolName`/`RuleIntent` was ever defined for sync, and
grepping every caller of `replaySyncQueue`/`queueMutationAfterNetworkFailure`
confirmed there is no fourth trigger mechanism hiding here the way
`isNetworkDiscoveryRequest` was hiding in the network domain (4g) — sync
really is only reachable from its own page today, which is correct given
what it does.

**Runtime** (`useRuntimeHistoryState.ts`) is session/turn browsing for
the AI runtime itself — `loadRuntimeSessions`, `loadRuntimeTurns`,
`createRuntimeHistorySession`, `restoreOrCreateRuntimeSession`. This is
the plumbing chat *runs on*, not a peer domain chat could invoke: asking
"show me my runtime sessions" through the chat runtime to browse the
chat runtime's own session history is circular in a way none of the
other nine domains audited so far are. No mutation exists to route
through the runtime-tool system in the first place — every function here
either reads (`loadRuntimeSessions`/`loadRuntimeTurns`) or manages the
runtime's own lifecycle (`createManagedRuntimeSession`/`ensureRuntimeSession`),
neither of which a merchant sentence would ever target.

**No bug found in either domain** (unlike 4g, which had one) — both
wiring paths from permanent-page button to REST endpoint were read in
full and found correct.

**Verdict**: no generated card, no new runtime tool, no code change, for
either domain. Both permanent pages stay exactly as important as they
are today.

## Compliance + Beta + Launch audit (Phase 4k — no card, no bug)

Confirms the prediction this document's own "When a permanent page is
still correct" section already made before this phase started: these
three domains are internal-operator/admin readiness dashboards, not
merchant-facing actions, and audited out that way.

`useReadinessState.ts` (all three domains share one hook, mirroring the
backend `domain-modularization-roadmap.md`'s own decision to keep them
together) exposes: security review, verification tier, tax config,
device trust, and account-deletion scheduling for **compliance**; access
status, feature-flag rollout, device tests, support tickets, and
telemetry for **beta**; launch status, rollout settings, checklist items,
and incidents for **launch**. Every one of these is an operator
configuring the *business's platform posture* (is this shop verified,
is beta access paused, is launch frozen) — not an action a merchant
would ever phrase as a chat sentence the way "mark delivered" or "add
customer Mary" are. None of it maps to a `RuntimeToolName` a merchant's
free text could plausibly trigger, and no `RuleIntent` covers any of it
today. Grepped for a fourth trigger mechanism the way 4g found one for
network — none exists; every mutation here is only reachable from its
own permanent page.

**No bug found** — every load/save/update path was read in full and
correctly threads through to its REST endpoint and `loadReports`
follow-up refresh.

**Verdict**: no generated card, no new runtime tool, no code change, for
all three domains. All three permanent pages stay exactly as important
as they are today.

## Reports + Notifications chat navigation (Phase 4l — implemented)

Unlike sync/runtime (4i-4j) and compliance/beta/launch (4k), reports and
notifications turned out to be genuinely chat-relevant, not operator
dashboards — but the audit found the gap in an unexpected place.

**What the audit found:**

- Both domains were already advertised as reachable through chat:
  `createAgentHelpReply()` (`agent-command-engine.ts`) tells every
  merchant "I can open Products, Suppliers, Customers, Invoices,
  Payments, My Network, Purchase receipts, Reports, or Alerts" — and
  `resolveAgentHelpDestination` already maps `reports`/`notifications`
  aliases to their `ShellView`s. But that path only fires through the
  `extractAgentHelpCommand` prefix ("help me...", "can you help me...").
  A bare **"show reports"** — the exact phrasing `show_products`/
  `show_invoices` already support with no prefix required — fell through
  to `unknown` and got a generic clarification reply instead of
  navigating, even though the agent's own help text implies it should
  work.
- Confirmed this is a real, load-bearing precedent to extend, not a new
  pattern to invent: `show_products`/`show_invoices` are plain
  `RuleIntent`s in the shared `@soko/tool-core` parser (used by both the
  frontend's local fallback decision engine and the real backend
  `/runtime/turns` HTTP route, since it's the same package on both
  sides), mapping to a `type: "navigate"` next-action that short-circuits
  locally — no card, no draft, no confirmation.
- Both `reports.summary` and `notifications.list` needed real backend
  wiring, not just a frontend regex: the actual data (`getBusinessReport`,
  `NotificationsDomain.listNotifications`) already existed as working
  public store methods (same ones the permanent pages' REST routes call),
  simply never exposed through the runtime-tool system.
- **A second real bug, one layer deeper than expected**: after wiring the
  new tools with `requiresConfirmation: false` on their own registry
  definitions, "show reports" still came back `needs_confirmation`. Root
  cause was a *third* place read-only tools must be listed: `services/api/src/cp2/agent-business-runtime.ts`'s
  `skillRequiresOwnerConfirmation()` is a hard-coded allowlist of tool
  names exempt from the default per-skill confirmation requirement —
  `products.list`/`invoices.list` were on it, the two new tools were not,
  so every default agent skill binding for them required explicit owner
  confirmation despite the tool definition itself saying otherwise. This
  is the same "forgot to add the new tool to an existing allowlist" bug
  class as every other phase's dropped-input bug, just one hop further
  from the parser than usual — found by running the real HTTP route
  end-to-end rather than trusting the registry definition alone, per the
  standing "verify the real path" discipline from Phase 4a.

**What was built:** `show_reports`/`show_notifications` `RuleIntent`s
(EN keywords/phrases mirroring `show_products`/`show_invoices` exactly),
`reports.summary`/`notifications.list` read-only `RuntimeToolName`s,
`"reports"`/`"notifications"` added to the navigate `view` union, backend
execution wired to the existing `getBusinessReport`/`listNotifications`
store methods, `skillRequiresOwnerConfirmation` extended, and the
frontend trigger (`useChatRuntimeState.ts`) loads the fresh data and
navigates as soon as either tool executes — identical shape to the
existing `products.list`/`invoices.list` triggers.

Regression tests: `tests/cp4-rule-parser.test.ts` (parser-level, verified
against real parser output first), `tests/cp10-sokoclaw-runtime.test.ts`
(new end-to-end test proving both tools execute for real through the
HTTP route and return real report/notification data, not just a
clarification), `tests/reports-notifications-navigation.test.ts`
(frontend wiring — verified to fail without the frontend implementation).

## Architectural enforcement (Phase 5 — implemented)

The last item on the roadmap. With every `ShellView` now audited
(Phases 4a-4l), this phase makes that discipline permanent instead of
relying on the next person to remember to repeat it.

**Import-boundary guard**: `scripts/check-shellview-boundary.mjs`
(wired as `pnpm check:shellview-boundary`, and into the `ci` script)
parses the live `ShellView` union in `apps/web/src/app-shell.ts` and
fails the build if it contains a member not present in the script's own
`approvedShellViews` map — an inline audit trail naming which phase
approved each view and why (shell chrome, a chat-invokable capability
shipped alongside its permanent page, or an audited-and-kept permanent
page). Adding a new `ShellView` now requires deliberately editing this
script and, per its own failure message, writing the audit as a new
section in this document — the exact question this session asked by
hand for every one of the fifteen domain views ("could this be a chat
capability instead of a permanent page?") can no longer be silently
skipped by a future change.

**Registry-only regression coverage**: already existed going into this
phase — `tests/generated-surface-registry.test.ts` (shipped alongside
the original generated-surface protocol in Phases 1-3) asserts
`ChatSurface.tsx` dispatches through `renderGeneratedSurface` keyed by
`content.type` and never grew a per-card `if`/field check as new cards
landed in Phases 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4f, and 4h — confirmed still true
and still passing after all twelve of those phases' generated-surface
cards shipped, with no changes needed this phase.

Regression tests: `tests/check-shellview-boundary.test.ts` (new — proves
the script passes against the real repository today, fails and names the
offending view when an undocumented `ShellView` is added to a fixture,
and passes when a fixture only uses an already-approved subset).

```

`SokoShell → SessionList → ConversationSession → Composer → GeneratedSurface`
are the only permanent frontend concepts. Catalogue, orders, checkout,
status, product management, search results, and the other 15 business
views do not get top-level navigation because implementing them as
conventional pages was easier — that is exactly the shortcut the mockups'
own design notes reject.

### When a permanent page is still correct

Not never. A view stays a permanent, directly-navigable page when:

- it is a settings/identity/security surface with no natural conversation
  phrasing (device sessions, passkeys, MFA, business compliance
  paperwork) — `IdentitySecurityPanel`/`ComplianceSurface` are candidates
  to remain reachable from a menu rather than forced into a chat turn;
- it is accessed far more often via deep link/notification than via a
  fresh conversation (e.g. opening a specific invoice from a payment
  reminder push);
- forcing it through conversation would require inventing a fake natural-
  language phrasing for something that is inherently a form review, not a
  request (bulk CSV import row correction is a plausible example).

Each of the 15 views gets this judgment call made explicitly during its
own migration phase (below), not decided in bulk here. Default assumption
going in: it becomes a generated surface unless a phase's own audit finds
a concrete reason it shouldn't.

## The generated-surface protocol (Phase 1 — implemented)

`ConversationMessageContent` (wire, already correct) is now carried
through to the frontend without flattening. `ChatMessage.content?:
ConversationMessageContent` replaces the five ad hoc optional fields
(`businessCards`, `productCaptureJobId`, `statusBroadcastId`,
`unifiedCheckoutId`, `confirmationToken` stays separate since it is read
independently of card rendering for the confirm-action flow).

`apps/web/src/generated-surface-registry.tsx` is the renderer registry:

```ts
type GeneratedSurfaceRenderer = (props: {
  content: ConversationMessageContent;
  businessId: string | null;
}) => ReactNode | null;

const generatedSurfaceRegistry: Partial<
  Record<ConversationMessageContent["type"], GeneratedSurfaceRenderer>
> = {
  "product-capture-progress": (...) => <ProductCaptureItemsCard ... />,
  "status-broadcast": (...) => <StatusBroadcastCard ... />,
  "unified-checkout": (...) => <FulfilmentSplitCard ... />,
  "owner-controls": (...) => <AccountBackendControls ... />
};

export function renderGeneratedSurface(...): ReactNode | null {
  const renderer = generatedSurfaceRegistry[content.type];
  return renderer === undefined ? null : renderer({ content, businessId });
}
```

An unrecognized `content.type` (a future server addition the client
hasn't shipped a renderer for yet) returns `null` and the message still
renders its `body` text — it degrades safely instead of crashing the
thread. This is the exact behavior required by "unknown surface types
must degrade safely."

Adding a new capability's generated card going forward is: add the
variant to `ConversationMessageContent`, add one registry entry. It does
not require touching `ChatSurface.tsx`'s render body again.

| 4a | Products: give the domain a chat-invokable capability/tool that renders inline in a session (found to need fixing two runtime-tool execution stubs, adding two new parser intents to both the primary and context-script parsers, and a currency/quantity parsing bug - not a small phase). Permanent `products` nav entry kept until a generated-surface replacement can be proven live in a browser | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Products chat-invokable capability" above |
| 4b | Suppliers: same pattern as 4a (found zero existing supplier runtime tools, and a product-vocabulary false-positive that would have silently misrouted supplier edits as product edits) | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Suppliers chat-invokable capability" above |
| 4c | Customers: same pattern as 4a/4b (customer.create already existed but dropped phone/email/notes; added customer.update; extended 4b's product-vocabulary exclusion guard rather than duplicating it) | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Customers chat-invokable capability" above |
| 4d | Invoices: found a materially harder problem than 4a-4c (product+quantity+price can't be reliably extracted from free text for a record that moves stock and money) - scoped to an interactive single-item composer card triggered by the existing create_invoice classification, no backend changes needed | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Invoices chat-invokable capability" above |
| 4e | Payments: same "composer card, no backend change" shape as 4d - `payment.record` has always been hard-coded invalid for the same reason (can't pick which of several open invoices from free text) | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Payments chat-invokable capability" above |
| 4f | Imports: found the domain was already mostly chat-capable - `document_import.confirm` already resolves and executes for real from chat via a third, separate proposal path (`createRuntimeDocumentImportProposal`); the one gap was inline row review before confirming | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Imports chat-invokable capability" above |
| 4g | Network: audited honestly rather than forced into the pattern - the domain's real chat capability (find suppliers through network) already existed via a separate mechanism, the rest is browser-API-gated (contact picker, OAuth) and cannot move to chat. No card; fixed one real bug (requestNetworkRoute always sent a hard-coded request, dropping the owner's real message) | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Network audit" above |
| 4h | Logistics: judged genuinely chat-relevant (unlike 4g) - "mark delivered"/"picked up" are natural merchant sentences and the backend mutation already existed, just never wired into the runtime-tool system. Same "composer card, no backend mutation change" shape as 4d/4e | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Logistics chat-invokable capability" above |
| 4i | Sync: audited honestly - offline mutation queue/IndexedDB machinery with no natural chat phrasing (both actions need a `syncItemId` chat can't carry) and already only reachable from its own page. No fourth trigger mechanism found hiding here (unlike 4g's network). No card, no bug | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Sync + Runtime audit" above |
| 4j | Runtime: audited honestly - session/turn browsing for the AI runtime itself, the plumbing chat runs on rather than a peer domain chat could invoke. No mutation exists to route through the runtime-tool system. No card, no bug | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Sync + Runtime audit" above |
| 4k | Compliance + Beta + Launch: audited together (one hook, `useReadinessState.ts`, mirrors the backend's own combined-phase decision) - confirmed the doc's own prediction that these are internal-operator platform-posture dashboards, not merchant-facing actions. No card, no bug | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Compliance + Beta + Launch audit" above |
| 4l | Reports + Notifications: audited together - both already advertised as chat-reachable via the help-prefixed path, but the bare `show_products`/`show_invoices`-style phrasing didn't work. Built the missing `show_reports`/`show_notifications` navigate intents, wired to the existing `getBusinessReport`/`listNotifications` store methods, and fixed a second confirmation-allowlist bug found only by testing the real HTTP route | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Reports + Notifications chat navigation" above |
| 5     | Architectural enforcement: import-boundary guard preventing a new permanent `ShellView` from being added without an explicit documented exception; regression tests asserting the generated-surface registry, not a growing if-chain, is the only way `ChatSurface.tsx` picks a card component                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Implemented** (this change) — see "Architectural enforcement" above                                                                             |

Legacy pages are removed only after their generated-surface replacement
is proven working — never a big-bang cutover. A catalogue page may
disappear while catalogue APIs and their domain hook remain untouched; an
orders page may disappear while order state remains essential. The
distinction is which layer serves conversation vs. permanent navigation,
not whether the underlying capability exists.

## Non-goals (carried forward from the original decomposition discipline)

Do not: create microservices; introduce a second agent runtime, MCP
implementation, or context runtime; inject model-generated HTML or
execute model-generated code; fabricate marketplace connector results;
fabricate contacts access; fabricate payment/settlement success for an
unsupported path; auto-publish AI-extracted listings without seller
confirmation; move business authorization to the client; remove a
permanent view before its generated-surface replacement exists and is
tested.
