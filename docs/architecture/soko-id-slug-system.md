# Canonical Store Slug System — Extending `sokoId`

Status: complete, with two explicit gaps named in §7 rather than silently skipped.

## 1. Why this doesn't build a new `Store`/`slug` system from scratch

The original request assumed Prisma, a `Store` model, and subdomain-based routing. None of that
exists in this codebase. What actually exists:

- No Prisma anywhere in the monorepo. Persistence is a hand-rolled `Cp2Store` class
  (`services/api/src/cp2/store.ts`) backed by Postgres via a generic envelope-table mechanism
  (`entity_id, business_id, account_id, user_id, parent_id, record jsonb, updated_at`), not an ORM.
- The entity is `Business` (`BusinessSummary`), not `Store`.
- A canonical, unique, DB-enforced, pinned-by-default store identifier **already exists**:
  `business.sokoId`, generated once at creation by `Cp2Store`'s private `createGlobalShopId`
  (`store.ts`, format `soko.<handle>`), with numeric-suffix collision handling already implemented
  (`soko.mama-mboga`, `soko.mama-mboga-2`, ...) - exactly the disambiguation strategy this task
  asked for.
- The web app is a **static site** on Render (`render.yaml`, `soko-market-web`, `runtime: static`,
  domain `soko.market` only, no wildcard) with all paths rewritten to `/index.html` client-side -
  there is no server-side "web middleware" layer capable of reading a `Host` header today.

Building a parallel Prisma-shaped `slug`/`SlugHistory` system alongside `sokoId` would have left
two competing canonical identifiers in the codebase - exactly what the original brief itself warned
against. Per direct confirmation from Julien, this phase **extends `sokoId` in place** instead.

## 2. What was added, mapped to the original deliverable list

Tests: `tests/soko-id-slug-system.test.ts` ("createSokoHandle - the slugify function" suite), covering every case the brief named (`Mama's Kitchen`, `Café Nyayo`, `Duka la Simu #2`, all-symbols/empty, over-length, reserved-word). |

## 3. The shared resolver and where it's used

`Cp2Store.resolveBusinessBySokoId(sokoId)` is the one place every channel resolves a sokoId:

- `GET /s/:slug` (the new universal fallback route, `routes.ts`) calls it directly.
- The rename endpoint calls it (equality check to allow a no-op "rename" to the current handle).
- Any future channel adapter (Telegram, WhatsApp) is expected to call it too - see §7.1 for why
  Telegram isn't wired yet.

**What was _not_ converged onto it, and why**: `requirePublicStorefrontBusiness`
(`services/api/src/cp2/storefront-access.ts`) is a pre-existing, separate, active-only lookup used
by 5 internal call sites (`store.ts`, `sales/store.ts` ×2, `messaging/store.ts` ×2) for the
already-established public storefront product/customer-care/order endpoints. It was **not**
refactored onto the new resolver. Reasoning: those call sites are internal API endpoints serving an
already-resolved path, not new channel entry points in the sense this task's brief meant (web
subdomain, Telegram, future channels); they have no need for stale/cooldown awareness (a request to
a retired sokoId there should keep 404ing, exactly as before); and converging them would require
threading a `sokoIdHistory` reference through `sales`/`messaging` domain `Deps` interfaces across
multiple files - a broader, separately-reviewable change than this task's actual scope. Flagging
this explicitly rather than silently leaving "two versions" unremarked: there are now two
lookups (`requirePublicStorefrontBusiness`, unchanged, active-only; `resolveBusinessBySokoId`, new,
active+stale-aware) serving genuinely different call sites with genuinely different needs, not one
lookup accidentally duplicated.

## 4. Web "subdomain" support is real string generation, blocked on a real infra step

`getStoreLinks().web` produces `https://{handle}.soko.market` - correct as a string, but **nothing
in this deployment can currently receive that request**. `soko-market-web` is a Render static site
with domain `soko.market` only; no wildcard custom domain is registered, and static sites have no
server-side Host-header middleware capability regardless. This is a genuine infra gap, not a code
gap: closing it requires registering a wildcard custom domain in Render's dashboard (an operational
step, not something committable from this repo) and deciding whether it should point at the static
web service or at `soko-market-api` (a real Node service that _could_ do Host-header routing and
302 to the real storefront path). `GET /s/:slug` (the universal fallback) is what actually resolves
today, using only the existing single `soko.market`/`api.soko.market` domains - it is the correct
thing to hand out in QR codes/flyers/etc. right now, not `getStoreLinks().web`.

## 5. Rename flow and cooldown

`renameSokoId` (`store.ts`) validates the new handle (length, charset, reserved-word check, then
`hasGlobalShopId` which also checks in-cooldown history), moves the old `sokoId` into
`sokoIdHistory` with `releasedAt: null`, and updates `business.sokoId`. `sokoid-cooldown-runner.ts`
periodically (default hourly, `SOKO_ID_COOLDOWN_RUNNER_INTERVAL_MS`) calls
`releaseExpiredSokoIds({cooldownMs})` (default 30 days, `SOKO_ID_COOLDOWN_MS` - the brief's own
proposed default, used since nothing more specific was given), which sets `releasedAt` on any
history entry old enough, freeing the handle. Both runner settings and the runner itself can be
disabled via `ENABLE_SOKO_ID_COOLDOWN_RUNNER=false`, matching the existing runners' convention
exactly.

While in cooldown (`releasedAt === null`), the old sokoId resolves as `"stale"` with a
`redirectTo` pointing at the business's current sokoId - `GET /s/:slug` turns this into a 410 with
the new location in the body (not a silent 404), matching the brief's explicit instruction.

## 6. Migration/backfill: there is nothing to backfill

Every business has always had a `sokoId` - `createGlobalShopId` runs unconditionally inside
`createBusiness`, so no business created before this phase lacks one. This phase adds no new
required field to `BusinessSummary` itself (only a new, empty-by-default history table), so there
is no existing-row migration to run, dry or otherwise. Confirmed directly, not assumed: every
existing business's `sokoId` continues to resolve exactly as it did before this phase, and the new
`cp2_soko_id_history` table starts and stays empty until the first real rename happens.

## 7. Test results

New/extended files: `tests/soko-id-slug-system.test.ts` (25 tests: slugify cases, reserved words,
generation/collision including "3rd Mama Mboga", the shared resolver's three states, rename
validation, cooldown release, idempotency), `tests/soko-id-routes.test.ts` (6 tests: the universal
redirect route's active/stale/never-existed responses over real HTTP via `buildApi`, the rename
endpoint's success/conflict/authorization-failure responses), `tests/soko-id-history-migration.test.ts`
(3 tests: additive-only SQL, scoped rollback, generic-mechanism registration), `tests/sokoid-cooldown-runner.test.ts`
(3 tests, mirroring `notification-delivery-runner.test.ts`'s exact pattern), `tests/store-links.test.ts`
(5 tests: link shapes, empty-telegram-when-unconfigured, trailing-slash handling, consistent
encoding, no whatsapp field). All 42 pass.

```

```

Full repo suite was run for regression-checking. This working tree currently has substantial
unrelated, uncommitted, in-progress work from a separate session (an MCP integration feature,
touching many domain-store files) - two things worth stating plainly rather than glossing over:

- `tests/user-purge-script.test.ts` currently fails, but not because of this phase: the other
  session added a `cp2_native_runtime_agents` collection to `postgres-store.ts`'s
  `normalizedCollections` without adding a purge-manifest classification for it. This phase's own
  new table (`cp2_soko_id_history`) **is** correctly classified (`scripts/purge-all-users.sql`) and
  the test's hardcoded counts were updated to match (159→160, 154→155) - confirmed by re-running
  the test and seeing the failure name the other session's table, not this phase's.
- A full project-wide `tsc --noEmit` currently reports 2 errors in `services/api/src/cp2/domains/native-runtime/store.ts`,
  also from that same in-progress, uncommitted work - unrelated to any file this phase touched.
  Every file this phase actually modified typechecks clean in isolation.

## 8. Explicit gaps (named, not silently skipped)

1. **Telegram `/start` deep-link resolution is not wired up.** `TelegramChannelAdapter.normalizeInbound`
   (`services/api/src/messaging/channel-gateway.ts:524`) already parses `/start <param>` - but the
   captured value (`linkToken`) is consumed by a _different_, security-sensitive, pre-existing
   feature: a per-customer, single-use, hashed, expiring channel-identity-link grant
   (`services/api/src/cp2/domains/messaging/store.ts:1877-1910`, `channelIdentityLinkGrants`) for
   linking an _already-known_ customer's Telegram account to an existing conversation - not for a
   stranger discovering a business by its public handle. The existing token length constraint
   (`{16,200}` chars) doesn't reliably distinguish "real link token" from "sokoId handle" (handles
   can legitimately exceed 16 chars), so safely disambiguating the two at the parsing layer is a
   real design decision, not a mechanical wiring change - and building a _new_ "anonymous stranger
   starts a fresh conversation with business X" bootstrap flow (what a cold `/start <handle>` would
   actually need to do something more useful than an acknowledgement reply) is its own
   product-and-security-sensitive feature. Rather than rush a change into that specific
   grant-consumption code path under this task's time budget, the exact integration point is named
   precisely: extend `normalizeInbound`'s regex to also capture a shorter sokoId-shaped param
   distinctly from `linkToken`, then in `messaging/store.ts`'s `ingestChannelWebhook` (right where
   the `grant === undefined` 401 currently throws), fall back to
   `store.resolveBusinessBySokoId(...)` before failing, and reply via the channel gateway's
   `sendMessage` rather than creating a channel link. `getStoreLinks().telegram` (the _generation_
   side) is done and tested; this is only the _receiving_ side.
2. **`getStoreLinks().web` (the `{handle}.soko.market` subdomain) doesn't resolve today** - see §4.
   Real infra work (a Render custom domain decision), not a code gap.
