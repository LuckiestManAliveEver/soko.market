# Hugging Face inference and dynamic model switching

This is the reference doc for how Hugging Face inference and multi-model switching actually work in
this repository, after the change described in `docs/implementation/huggingface-model-switching-report.md`.
Read `docs/architecture/huggingface-model-switching-audit.md` first for how this was scoped against
the pre-existing architecture — this doc does not repeat that reasoning, only the resulting design.

## 1. The five layers, and where each one lives

```
User
  -> Soko unified chat (apps/web: QuickRuntimeSwitcher.tsx / AgentModelPanel.tsx)
  -> Selected agent (AgentDefinition, unchanged by a model switch)
  -> Native runtime binding resolver (NativeRuntimeBindingStore.resolveRuntimeBinding)
  -> Model + provider (runtimeModels / aiModelRegistry, ModelRuntimeAdapter)
  -> Execution environment (the `vercel` execution target: services/ai-runtime on Vercel)
  -> Model response -> Soko tool-authorization boundary (packages/tool-core, unchanged) -> chat
```

Agent, model, provider and execution environment are four independently swappable dimensions,
exactly as the task brief required, but three of the four (agent, native runtime binding, tool
authorization) needed **zero code changes** for this feature — they were already provider-agnostic
by construction. The actual work was entirely in the "model + provider" and "execution environment"
layers: making Hugging Face a second, concurrently-available option there instead of an exclusive
deployment-wide mode.

## 2. Model registry

Two registries, both extended (not replaced):

- `runtimeModels` (`packages/shared-types/src/index.ts`) — the closed set of models that get a real,
  booted `ModelRuntimeAdapter` at server start (`services/api/src/index.ts`). Now includes `qwen3-4b`
  (`provider: "huggingface"`, `providerModelId: "Qwen/Qwen3-4B"`, `contextWindow: 32_768`,
  `requiresArtifact: false`).
- `aiModelRegistry` (`services/api/src/cp2/domains/agent-runtime/model-catalog.ts`) — the catalog
  surfaced to `GET /v1/ai-models` and the UI. Now includes a matching `qwen3-4b` entry with
  `canonicalModelId: "Qwen/Qwen3-4B"` (the provider-specific id, kept separate from the internal
  registry id `qwen3-4b` per the task brief's requirement), `supportsToolCalling: false` and
  `supportsStructuredOutput: false` (unverified for the featherless-ai-routed endpoint as of this
  writing — do not flip these without confirming against the live provider first).

`RuntimeModelDefinition.requiresArtifact` is the one new field on the registry type: `false` for a
model served remotely with nothing to download (Hugging Face today), defaulting to `true` (unchanged
behavior) for every model registered before this field existed.

## 3. Making Hugging Face concurrent instead of exclusive

Before this change, `services/ai-runtime`'s `INFERENCE_PROVIDER` env var picked exactly one engine
for the _entire deployment_: `llama-cpp` (download-and-run a GGUF artifact) or `huggingface` (route
every request to a Hub model via `HF_MODEL_MAP`, ignoring the artifact). A deployment could never
serve both at once, and switching meant a redeploy.

`resolveInferenceEngine()` (`services/ai-runtime/src/vercel-handler.ts`) now makes this a per-request
decision:

```ts
function resolveInferenceEngine(config, modelId):
  if HF_MODEL_MAP has modelId -> route to Hugging Face with that mapped id
  else if config.provider === "huggingface" and HF_MODEL_ID is set -> route to Hugging Face (legacy
    exclusive-mode fallback, unchanged behavior for deployments still using that mode)
  else -> route to llama-cpp
```

`readVercelInferenceConfig()` now builds the Hugging Face config block whenever `HF_TOKEN` is set —
not only when `INFERENCE_PROVIDER=huggingface`. This means the **recommended deployment shape** is:
leave `INFERENCE_PROVIDER=llama-cpp` (the default) and set `HF_TOKEN` + `HF_MODEL_MAP` anyway. Any
model id present in the map is then served by Hugging Face; every other enabled model keeps running
through llama.cpp in the exact same deployment, with no redeploy required to move a model between
engines. The old exclusive `INFERENCE_PROVIDER=huggingface` mode still works byte-for-byte as before,
for any deployment that depends on it.

`parseRequest()` in the same file only requires the wire-format `artifact` field when the resolved
engine is `llama-cpp`; a Hugging Face-routed request carries no artifact at all. On the `services/api`
side, `createVercelModelAdapter()` (`services/api/src/inference/model-runtime.ts`) takes a
`requiresArtifact` flag (sourced from `RuntimeModelDefinition.requiresArtifact`) and skips
`ModelArtifactStore.resolveArtifact/verifyArtifact/createDownloadUrl` entirely when false, reporting
`provider: "remote-chat-completions"` instead of `"llama.cpp"` in generation results and health
checks, so usage/health telemetry never misattributes a Hugging Face call to the GGUF engine.

## 4. Model-selection hierarchy

Unchanged: the pre-existing `NativeRuntimeBindingStore.resolveRuntimeBinding()` already implements
exactly the precedence the task brief asked for — (1) an explicit `runtimeBindingId` on the
conversation, (2) the business/account's most recent active binding, (3) the platform default
(`repositoryDefaultRuntimePolicy`, admin-overridable via the existing `PLATFORM_DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` env
var). This feature does not add a second resolution path; Qwen3-4B and any future Hugging
Face-routed model become selectable through this exact mechanism once registered.

**Qwen3-4B is registered, available, and marked `recommended: true`, but is deliberately not the
compiled-in platform default (`repositoryDefaultRuntimePolicy.modelId`, still `smollm2-360m`).**
`render.yaml` provisions `PLATFORM_DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` as an operator-set (`sync: false`) value on the
live Render deployment, whose current value this repository cannot see. Flipping the code-level
default to `qwen3-4b` would silently change platform-default routing behavior for that deployment if
its dashboard value happens to be unset — and would try to serve every zero-preference business
through Hugging Face without confirming `HF_TOKEN`/`HF_MODEL_MAP` are configured on the ai-runtime
side first. Making Qwen3-4B the actual live default is therefore an explicit administrator action:
set `PLATFORM_DEFAULT_MODEL_ID=qwen3-4b` (this already-existing env var) once Hugging Face is
configured and validated. This satisfies "the default must be configurable by the platform
administrator" literally, without an unverifiable silent behavior change to production.

## 5. Conversation continuity and context budgeting

Unchanged. `contextCharacterBudgetForModel()` already derives its budget from a model's declared
`contextWindow` — Qwen3-4B's `32_768` flows through automatically. Conversation history, tool
results, and task state are unaffected by which `ModelRuntimeAdapter` ultimately serves a turn: they
live in `conversations`/`conversation_messages`/`cp2_runtime_task_heads` regardless of provider. A
model swap mid-task goes through the pre-existing `POST /v1/runtime/:taskId/swaps/model` endpoint
(runtime handoff protocol), which was not modified.

## 6. Credential architecture

Three distinct credentials, never conflated:

1. **Platform-managed inference token** — `ai-runtime`'s `HF_TOKEN` (required for any Hugging
   Face-routed model). Server-side only, never reaches a browser, never logged.
2. **Discovery token** — `services/api`'s `HF_TOKEN` (optional). Used only to raise Hub search rate
   limits for registry discovery (`huggingface-model-catalog.ts`), never used for inference. Kept
   deliberately separate from (1) despite the identical env var name on the other service.
3. **User-connected (BYO) inference credential** — a business's own Hugging Face personal access
   token, stored via the pre-existing `ExternalConnectionsDomain`
   (`cp2_external_registry_connections`, encrypted with the same primitive as social-login OAuth
   tokens). This repository's credential storage already supported connecting an HF account for
   discovery; this feature adds one column and one endpoint so that connection can _also_, with a
   separate explicit step, be authorized for inference billing:

   - `inference_authorized boolean not null default false` (migration `097`). Connecting an account
     never sets this true — the discovery scope and the inference-billing scope are two different
     authorizations with different financial consequences, so one is never inferred from the other.
   - `POST /v1/external-connections/:id/inference-authorization` (body `{authorized: boolean}`) is
     the only action that changes it. Setting `false` always succeeds; setting `true` requires the
     connection to still be `status: "connected"` with a decryptable token.
   - `ExternalConnectionsDomain.resolveInferenceToken(accountId, provider)` — the read path an
     inference call must use — returns a token only when `inferenceAuthorized` is true, `null`
     otherwise. `resolveToken()` (the pre-existing discovery read path) is unaffected and must never
     be used to source a credential for a billed model call.
   - **A business opts a specific agent binding into own-account billing with
     `POST /api/agents/:agentId/model-binding/billing-mode`** (body `{shopId, billingMode: "platform"
| "own-account"}`). Setting `"own-account"` is rejected with `409
INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL_NOT_AUTHORIZED` unless the account already has a usable, inference-
     authorized connection for the active model's provider — the endpoint never accepts the
     preference "on trust" and leaves it to fail silently later. The preference is stored on the
     **native runtime binding** (`NativeRuntimeBindingSummary.configuration.billingMode`), not on the
     model row: `cp2_native_runtime_models` is a single shared catalog entry reused by every business
     that activates a given model id, so storing a billing preference there would leak one business's
     choice onto every other business using the same model. The binding, by contrast, is genuinely
     scoped to one (business, account, agent) triple. A routine model re-verification/re-activation
     preserves whatever billing mode is already set (`NativeRuntimeBindingStore.activateVerifiedModel`)
     — only the billing-mode endpoint itself changes it.
   - **This is wired all the way into a live chat turn**, not just the wire format:
     `AgentRuntimeStore.createRuntimeModelRoute` already threads the calling `accountId` through to
     `resolveRuntimeModelProvider` → `resolveNativeRuntimeModelProvider`
     (`native-runtime-routing.ts`), whose `resolveOwnAccountCredential` helper reads the resolved
     binding's `configuration.billingMode`, and — only when it is exactly `"own-account"` — calls the
     injected `resolveInferenceCredential` (wired from `Cp2Store` to
     `ExternalConnectionsDomain.resolveInferenceToken`) and attaches the result to the
     `ModelRuntimeContext` passed to `runtimeProviderFromAdapter`. The credential lookup is
     synchronous (`decryptOAuthToken` is plain AES-GCM, no I/O), so this required no change to the
     resolver's deliberately pure, synchronous design — every existing caller that omits `accountId`/
     `resolveInferenceCredential` keeps its exact prior behavior. If the account's own credential
     becomes unresolvable after being set (revoked, connection removed), the turn silently continues
     under the platform credential rather than failing the turn — this degrades billing attribution
     rather than availability, and is a known, accepted tradeoff, not an oversight.
   - Covered by `tests/native-runtime-execution-target-resolution.test.ts` (unit: the resolver logic
     in isolation) and `tests/agent-model-billing-mode.test.ts` (integration: the full connect →
     authorize → set-billing-mode → persists-across-reactivation flow via real HTTP routes).

Every credential path shares the same guarantees: HTTPS transit, server-side validation before
persistence (one real API call against the provider), encryption at rest
(`encryptOAuthToken`/`decryptOAuthToken`), account-scoped resolution (a business can never read
another business's connection — enforced by `accountId` equality checks in every domain method), and
exclusion from logs, telemetry, and model context. `resolveExternalConnectionToken`/
`resolveExternalConnectionInferenceToken` on `Cp2Store` are explicitly documented as internal-only
and are never exported from a route handler.

## 7. Free-tier and spending safeguards

Verified against Hugging Face's own pricing docs (`huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/pricing`,
checked 2026-09-24): free accounts get **$0.10/month** in Inference Providers credit; PRO/Team/
Enterprise get $2.00/seat/month. Extra usage past that requires purchasing credits — Hugging Face
does not document an automatic "keep charging a card" behavior for a free account with no payment
method on file, and this repository does not assume one.

Two independent layers:

- **Provider-side** (authoritative, not implemented here): the administrator should configure the
  actual spending limit in the Hugging Face billing dashboard
  (`huggingface.co/settings/billing`) and, for Team/Enterprise, the org-level spending cap mentioned
  in that doc. This repository cannot see or set that from application code.
- **Application-side backstop** (implemented, `HF_FREE_TIER_ONLY` env var on `services/ai-runtime`):
  - `huggingface-runtime.ts` classifies an HTTP 402 response from Hugging Face as
    `INFERENCE_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`, non-retryable — distinct from a generic failure.
  - When `HF_FREE_TIER_ONLY=true`, one confirmed `INFERENCE_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` response trips a
    process-lifetime latch (`vercel-handler.ts`) that immediately refuses every subsequent
    Hugging-Face-routed request with the same error, without calling Hugging Face again — "stop
    when spending cannot be bounded reliably," not "back off and retry the paid path."
  - **Named limitation**: this latch is per warm serverless-function instance, not distributed. It
    resets on cold start and does not coordinate across concurrently running instances. It is a
    safety net on top of the provider-side limit, never a replacement for it — this is stated
    explicitly in the env var's own doc comment in `.env.example` so it cannot be mistaken for a
    hard guarantee.

Per-request/model/output-token limits, concurrency bulkheads and a circuit breaker
(`INFERENCE_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, `INFERENCE_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_*`, `INFERENCE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`) already
existed and apply identically to Hugging Face-routed and llama.cpp-routed requests — they were not
provider-specific before this change and remain so.

## 8. What is implemented vs. designed-only

**Implemented, tested, and wired into the live request path:**

- Concurrent per-model Hugging Face/llama.cpp routing in the same deployment.
- Qwen3-4B registered, catalog-visible, activatable through the existing atomic binding-activation
  endpoint.
- 402 budget-exhaustion classification and the `HF_FREE_TIER_ONLY` process-lifetime latch.
- `providerCredential` wire plumbing from `services/api`'s adapter through to `services/ai-runtime`'s
  Hugging Face call, preferring a supplied credential over the platform token.
- The `inference_authorized` credential-scope column, its dedicated authorization endpoint, and
  `resolveInferenceToken`'s scope-gated read.
- The merchant-funded-model cost-confirmation gate in both `QuickRuntimeSwitcher.tsx` and
  `AgentModelPanel.tsx` (a pre-existing gap in both surfaces — cost responsibility was being sent to
  the activation endpoint without ever asking the merchant first), each with its own dedicated test
  file (`tests/quick-runtime-switcher.test.tsx`, `tests/agent-model-panel.test.tsx`).
- **BYO-credential resolution wired into the live per-turn chat call.** Resolving whether it is
  synchronous turned out to remove the obstacle an earlier pass of this doc named: decrypting a
  stored token is plain AES-GCM with no I/O, so `resolveNativeRuntimeModelProvider` stays exactly as
  pure and synchronous as before while still resolving a real credential per turn. See §6 for the
  full mechanism and `POST /api/agents/:agentId/model-binding/billing-mode` for the write path.

**Out of scope, not built:**

- Task-type-based automatic model routing (§9 of the audit) — genuinely new capability, not required
  by the task brief's explicit precedence hierarchy.
- A frontend UI control for choosing "own-account" billing mode (the API endpoint exists and is
  fully tested; `QuickRuntimeSwitcher.tsx`/`AgentModelPanel.tsx` do not yet expose it).
- Distributing `HF_FREE_TIER_ONLY`'s latch across serverless instances (still per-process, see §7).

Nothing in this list was reported as done in the final report unless it is in the first category.
