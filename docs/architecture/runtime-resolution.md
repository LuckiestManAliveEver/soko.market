# Runtime resolution

The API's native runtime binding resolver (`services/api/src/cp2/domains/native-runtime/store.ts`,
`NativeRuntimeBindingStore`) is the sole authoritative server-side path for "which agent adapter +
model + execution host handles this turn." It reads the persisted binding, agent, binding-model roles,
installations, and hosts. Client routing may propose a previously authorized local completion; it
cannot invent a model, host, assignment, or tool permission.

## One resolver

`NativeRuntimeBindingStore.resolveRuntimeBinding({ businessId, accountId?, agentId,
conversationId? })` is the only effective-runtime decision. Storefront chat supplies
`conversationId`; the merchant's direct runtime-session chat supplies its authenticated
`accountId`. Conversation calls derive the account from the conversation as a defense in depth.
Both shapes enter the same function and receive the same binding, agent, model, installation, and
host result.

Every shop-scoped read and write uses `profile.agentId` (the business id for the default profile).
Zero-setup provisioning and explicit activation therefore update the same binding identity.
Settings cannot read a business-id binding while chat silently reads a second `builtin:pi:v1`
binding. The built-in Pi record remains the global platform-default resource; inheriting it does
not create a second per-shop identity space.

## Resolution precedence

For a given `(businessId, agentId)`:

1. **Conversation override** - only when a `conversationId` is present: the conversation's own
   `runtimeBindingId`, if the caller explicitly reassigned one via `activateVerifiedRuntimeBinding`.
2. **Shop/account binding** - the most recently active `NativeRuntimeBindingSummary` for this
   `(businessId, accountId, agentId)`, however it got there (explicit user activation via
   `activateVerifiedModel`, or zero-setup lazy provisioning below).
3. **Platform default** - `builtin:soko-default-runtime:v1`, materialized by migration 077 as Pi +
   SmolLM2 360M + the backend execution host. A conversation carrying this binding id is treated as
   inherited default, so a later account override still wins.

## Zero-setup first-chat provisioning

`ensureDefaultRuntimeForTurn` (`agent-runtime/store.ts`) is the idempotent, lazy path that turns
`platformDefaultRuntime` policy (`PLATFORM_DEFAULT_MODEL_ID=smollm2-360m`,
`PLATFORM_DEFAULT_EXECUTION_TARGET=backend`, engine `Pi`) into a real, shop-scoped binding the first
time a shop's agent needs one - for a business still on the default agent definition; any other
agent definition's own `runtimeAdapterId` is resolved instead (see
`ADR-collapse-harness-into-agent.md`):

1. Call the canonical resolver. If it already has an available backend candidate, do nothing.
2. Resolve the agent's runtime adapter and confirm `platformDefaultRuntime.executionTarget ===
   "backend"`. Probe `agentAdapter.canRun(...)` for the adapter itself.
3. Walk preferred model ids (the shop's own AI-model preference, the platform default model,
   `defaultAiModelId`, then the rest of the enabled chat-capable catalog) and probe each one's
   `ModelRuntimeAdapter.canRun(...)` (a real `/v1/models/:id/probe` call against the backend
   inference host), collecting up to two verified candidates.
4. Call `NativeRuntimeBindingStore.ensureDefaultRuntimeBinding` with those candidates. It is
   idempotent per `(businessId, accountId, agentId)`: an existing active binding is never reset,
   only extended with a hosted fallback role if it lacks one; a shop with nothing yet gets a brand
   new binding (`activateVerifiedModel` under the hood) marked
   `configuration.source = "zero-setup-provisioning"`.

This is a bootstrap repair path for fresh in-memory stores and deployments upgrading from a draft
default. Migration 077 makes the production platform default a real graph up front. The same logic
runs for conversation and conversation-free turns, and for the settings-facing effective-runtime
read below - the same repair keeps a shop's readiness banner accurate without requiring a chat
message first.

### Control-plane deadline (incident postmortem)

Steps 2 and 3 above make real network calls to whatever execution host the candidate model
declares. Before this was bounded, an unreachable or degraded inference host (the exact condition
a production inference outage produces) let this repair step block for the full
`VERCEL_INFERENCE_TIMEOUT_MS` budget (300 000 ms by default) - a ceiling sized for a real generation
call, not a lightweight availability check. Two request paths call this function while awaiting it
directly: `POST /v1/messages` / `POST /businesses/:id/runtime/turns` (chat) and
`GET /businesses/:id/runtime/effective` (Settings' readiness banner and quick switcher). The
frontend's own request timeout is a flat 20 seconds (`apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`), so during a real
inference outage both chat and Settings blocked well past that boundary and surfaced as the generic
client-side "The request took too long and was cancelled." instead of a fast, typed failure - the
shared dependency behind that incident.

The fix applies the same `withRuntimeDeadline` control-plane deadline (`cp2/runtime-deadline.ts`,
5 seconds by default) already used by `getEffectiveRuntime`'s own readiness probe:

- The agent adapter probe (`agentAdapter.canRun`) is wrapped individually.
- Every remaining candidate model's `canRun` probe runs **concurrently** via `Promise.allSettled`
  under **one shared** deadline, not one deadline applied serially per candidate - with several
  catalog models to try, a per-candidate-only bound could still add up to minutes of total latency
  before the repair step gave up. `Promise.allSettled` never itself rejects, so it is the deadline
  race around it that guarantees this step resolves even when every adapter hangs; an adapter call
  already past the deadline may keep running in the background, exactly like every other
  `withRuntimeDeadline` use site in this file - only the caller's wait is bounded.

A timed-out probe is treated exactly like a failed one: the candidate is skipped, and if no
candidate becomes available the caller falls through to its existing typed failure
(`RUNTIME_MODELS_UNAVAILABLE`, `AGENT_MODEL_NOT_CONFIGURED`) well inside the frontend's 20-second
timeout, instead of a generic client-side cancellation. See `tests/zero-setup-native-runtime.test.ts`
for the regression coverage (a hung model host on both the chat and the settings path).

## Effective runtime API

`GET /businesses/:businessId/runtime/effective` calls the same resolver and verifies both the
selected agent adapter and model adapter. It returns public resource identity, resolution source, and
`READY`/`UNAVAILABLE`; it never returns host endpoints or credentials. The quick switcher and
advanced settings readiness banner consume this response rather than deriving readiness from the
model catalog in React.

## Execution target resolution

`resolveExecutionTarget` (`native-runtime-routing.ts`) is deliberately strict: given a resolved
native binding, it reads the selected candidate's host type, falling back to the model's declared
`configuration.executionTarget` only when no host is attached yet. If neither is a valid
`ModelExecutionTarget`, it throws `409 NO_COMPATIBLE_EXECUTION_TARGET` - there is intentionally no
implicit "assume backend" branch, because a model that never declared where it runs is a routing
failure, not something safe to guess at. This function does not special-case any provider (OpenAI,
Ollama, or otherwise); provider-specific behavior lives entirely behind the registered
`ModelRuntimeAdapter` for the resolved execution target.

For an ordinary turn, once resolution succeeds:

1. Reject inactive models, unavailable installations, unhealthy hosts, incompatible runtime
   contracts, missing model capabilities, and cross-account/shop hosts.
2. Select the first available candidate deterministically by role and priority (primary, then
   fallbacks in priority order).
3. Execute through the provider-neutral `ModelRuntimeAdapter` interface
   (`services/api/src/inference/model-runtime.ts`) - for the backend target this is an HTTPS call
   over Render's private network to the `soko-market-inference` service, which runs Ollama with
   `smollm2:360m-instruct-q4_0` in-container.
4. On a retryable, pre-side-effect inference failure, add the candidate key to the attempted set and
   try the next candidate. The persisted finite role list bounds failover.
5. Execute tools only after normal server parsing, authorization, confirmation, and idempotency
   checks.

Selection and completion telemetry records binding, conversation (or `"runtime-unbound"`), model,
target, host, resolution source, fallback index/reason, error category, and latency. It excludes
prompts, message contents, credentials, and tokens.

## History

Migration 063 introduced the native graph; migrations 065-072 migrated the retired execution
fabric, provider-specific target values, and the Pi + SmolLM2 360M zero-setup default without
invalidating conversations. Migrations 075/076 (`Unify runtime binding on
NativeRuntimeBindingStore`) dropped the legacy `cp2_agent_model_bindings` table and its dual-write
fallback tier entirely. Migration 077 materialized the default model/host/installation association.
`NativeRuntimeBindingStore` is the only runtime-binding storage and resolver.
