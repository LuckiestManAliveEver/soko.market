# Soko agent manifest

`soko-agent.yaml` is the portable, declarative form of an agent. It describes behavior and
requirements; it is not an executable package. The canonical TypeScript contract and validator
are `PortableAgentManifest` and `validatePortableAgentManifest` in `@soko/shared-types`. The
machine-readable schema is [soko-agent.schema.json](./soko-agent.schema.json).

```yaml

  id: portable:shop-assistant
  name: Shop Assistant
  description: Helps manage catalogue, customers, and orders

Instruction files are manifest-relative context documents. Absolute paths, URLs, parent-directory
traversal, executable commands, endpoints, host/device IDs, credentials, and provider model IDs
are rejected. Tools are identifiers only; the trusted Soko tool registry supplies implementation,
authorization, input validation, confirmation, and audit behavior.

`preferredModelId` is a preference rather than an embedded model. The runtime may choose another
compatible model when the preferred model is unavailable. Likewise, `preferredTargets` ranks
locations but never embeds a permanent execution host.
