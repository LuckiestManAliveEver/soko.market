# Runtime handoff implementation report

Repository changes are implemented and verified as described below. This is **not a claim that the
reported production request was reproduced or that a shipping local executor was certified**.
The runtime protocol works with compatible executable adapters in tests; installations with no
such adapter remain explicitly unavailable. No production deployment or database change was made.

## 1. Root cause and traced request paths

The old settings hook emitted the installation-disabled message from a frontend build flag and
returned without issuing a runtime handoff request. Its sibling profile/model/runtime requests
could still fail independently. The generic message comes from the 20-second AbortController in
`apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`, which remains unchanged.

Confirmed backend wait points were effective-runtime readiness and model test/activation awaiting
adapter `canRun`/`healthCheck` promises without a service-level deadline. A stalled adapter could
therefore outlive the frontend safeguard. These probes now have a five-second server deadline.
The exact stalled production endpoint is **not established**: no failed URL/request ID or production
trace was supplied. The code cannot justify assigning that particular incident to a specific probe.

Other confirmed architectural bugs were missing backend capability discovery; committing a host
swap before activation validation; omitted handoff methods in the Postgres mutation-interception
list; and permitting a successful runtime response when persistence had not been confirmed.

Final path:

```text
Settings action -> useRuntimeHandoff -> RuntimeHandoffController
-> /v1/runtime/:taskId capabilities / handoffs / transfers
-> RuntimeHandoffDomain -> NativeRuntimeBindingStore -> execution host
-> unpromoted RuntimeHandoff checkpoint -> target prepare/restore
-> receipt or hosted model/harness readiness -> compare-and-swap commit
-> Postgres persistence barrier -> canonical frontend routing
```

An unsupported target now returns a specific 409 before checkpoint/activation or persistence waits.
A regression test verifies this even with a deliberately stalled persistence queue.

## 2. Architecture and continuity

The existing native agent/model/binding/host/installation graph, immutable RuntimeHandoff,
conversation store, local database, LocalProvider and executor adapter interfaces are reused.
Location is independent of model/provider identity. No retired Execution Fabric or additional
execution framework was introduced.

Task/agent/model identity, checkpoint cursor/state, action IDs/status and context references survive
both directions. Local conversation messages synchronize under their original IDs. Completed hosted
turns record safe checkpoint references; active tool calls finish at the source before a handoff
can start. Pending tool actions require authorization again; tokens/PINs/tool inputs and protected
file contents are not copied. Arbitrary native call stacks are not migrated mid-call.

## 4. Schema changes

Only migration 085 is new: `cp2_runtime_transfers` stores mutable operation progress separately from
immutable `cp2_runtime_handoffs`. It uses the existing CP2 entity/JSON record shape. Generated
columns expose task, status, source/checkpoint IDs and host IDs. Foreign keys reference existing
checkpoints and execution hosts; checks restrict status/identity; indexes enforce one active
transfer per task and unique account/task/idempotency keys. There are no destructive resets or
alterations to existing migrations. Existing native schema fields supply host configuration and
lease metadata.

All migrations through 085 were applied to a disposable Postgres 16 database. The migration runner
was replayed successfully. Dedicated schema tests applied 083/084/085 with 085 repeated; tests also
verified foreign keys, invalid states and concurrency constraints. Production migration state was
not queried or assumed.

## 5. API contracts

Prefix: `/v1/runtime/:taskId`. Authorization uses the existing session cookie. Mutation requests
include `x-soko-device-id`; transfer creation requires `Idempotency-Key`.

```http
GET /capabilities
POST /hosts/:hostId/heartbeat
{ "connected": true }

POST /handoffs
Idempotency-Key: unique-attempt-key
{ "targetExecutionHostId": "local-host", "expectedHandoffId": "source-checkpoint" }
```

Creation returns 202 with the transfer ID, `TARGET_ACTIVATING`, `checkpointId`, source/target IDs,
expiry and ownership metadata. An unavailable host returns a deterministic 409 with code/message.
Retries return the same operation; conflicting reuse returns 409.

```http
GET /transfers/:id
GET /handoffs/:checkpointId

POST /transfers/:id/complete
{ "receipt": { "handoffId": "target-checkpoint", "agentId": "same-agent",
  "modelId": "same-model", "harness": true, "artifacts": true,
  "protectedContext": true, "businessState": true } }

POST /transfers/:id/fail
{}
```

Hosted completion uses `{}` and server model/harness readiness probes. Completion/failure responses
contain the canonical transfer status; FAILED includes `failureCode` and `message`. Runtime durability
that remains unconfirmed returns 503 `RUNTIME_PERSISTENCE_PENDING`. Legacy host swaps require this
acknowledged protocol in both directions. Read-only business status without a selected conversation
uses the existing `/businesses/:businessId/runtime/effective` endpoint.

## 6. State machine

```text
PENDING -> CHECKPOINTING -> CHECKPOINTED -> TARGET_ACTIVATING
        -> RESTORING -> VERIFYING -> COMPLETED
Any nonterminal state -> FAILED
```

The lifecycle is validated in code. Checkpoints remain immutable. One synchronous canonical commit
updates head/binding/instance after target readiness, followed by confirmed database persistence.
This follows the repository's existing single-writer deployment boundary; it does not make multiple
independent CP2 API writers safe.

## 7. Failure and recovery behavior

| Condition                                | Result                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Local bridge disappears or lease expires | Commit rejected; operation FAILED; source remains canonical                                  |
| Checkpoint failure                       | CHECKPOINT_FAILED; old head/binding preserved                                                |
| Restore or hosted readiness failure      | FAILED; source preserved; explicit retry can use a new attempt key                           |
| Duplicate / crossing request             | Return canonical operation or explicit conflict; no duplicate active operation               |
| Browser refresh                          | Reload the durable operation via saved identity; Resume handoff or Go hosted; no blind rerun |
| Lost completion response                 | Recover completed canonical state; never roll back a completed transfer                      |
| In-flight hosted turn                    | Immediate HANDOFF_IN_PROGRESS; let the original turn save its checkpoint, then retry         |
| Unconfirmed DB persistence               | Explicit 503; refresh canonical operation before changing routing                            |

Offline means local execution with eventual synchronization. It does not log out the account, erase
hosted data, or permanently disable syncing. Account/business/host ownership, initiating device and
business-owner membership are checked on the backend, including retries. Existing protected-context
and owner PIN boundaries remain in force.

The broad suite was followed by targeted reruns as fixes were finalized. Environment-dependent tests
in the broad suite remain skipped; the handoff migration and restart tests were run separately with
`CP2_POSTGRES_TEST_DATABASE_URL` set to the disposable database. Earlier regression failures were
fixed: personal-conversation business scope, purge table counts, lost-response return handling,
legacy migration-test isolation and incomplete browser mock session metadata.

## 10. Remaining requirements and verification limits

- A real device/bridge and compatible executable adapter must be provisioned to certify live local
  execution. This checkout has no shipping full LocalHandoffHost implementation or installer;
  business-data caching and the standalone local model are insufficient. No live device was available.
- The failed production request URL/ID and server trace are still needed to identify the exact
  original production stall. The frontend-disabled path itself issued no handoff request.
- Applying migration 085 and deploying these changes to the actual installation has not been done.
  Production schema state and the single-writer deployment topology require deployment verification.

These limits mean the original production incident and live-executor acceptance criteria are not
claimed complete. The [canonical runtime document](runtime-handoff.md) records the supported adapter
contract, deployment boundary and remaining installation requirement explicitly.
