# Agent runtime vs. the "eval docs" research standards

## Verdict, up front

**The repo is not "agentic" in the sense almost every paper in this folder uses the word, and
that's mostly the right call for what it is — but two gaps are real problems, not just scope
choices.**

Soko's runtime (`services/api/src/cp2/domains/agent-runtime`) is a deterministic rule engine with
a single LLM call as a last resort, wrapped in hand-coded validation and a human confirmation gate.
Against the 2022-2023 "agent loop" papers (ReAct, Toolformer, Reflexion, Self-Refine, Voyager), it
implements essentially none of the interleaved reasoning/acting/self-critique machinery those
papers define as the standard — by design, not by oversight, and for a system that drafts invoices
and payments, that conservatism is defensible. Against the 2025-2026 self-improving-harness papers
(GEPA, Meta-Harness, Continual Harness, Darwin Gödel Machine, OpenJarvis, Prime Agent), the gap is
larger and less defensible: those papers converge hard on "gate every prompt/harness change against
held-out evals with full trace visibility and versioned lineage," and Soko has exactly one
rudimentary, manually-triggered analog of that (`model-templates/strategies.ts`) that doesn't reach
the live LLM prompt.

The two gaps worth fixing are not "add agenticness for its own sake" — they're places where the
repo's own documented behavior (`docs/agent-evaluation-feedback-loop.md`) already promises something
the code doesn't yet do:

1. **No reasoning trace survives a model-fallback turn.** The model's single JSON output is parsed
   and discarded; nothing like ReAct's or Self-Refine's practice of keeping the "why" is logged
   anywhere a human could audit a disputed `create_invoice`/`payment.record` proposal after the
   fact.
2. **Memory has no lifecycle**, and the docs already say so: `docs/agent-evaluation-feedback-loop.md`
   states outright that "automatic retention cleanup and reusable-workflow promotion are not yet
   background jobs." Every paper that touches memory (MemGPT, Recursive Language Models, GEPA) treats
   unbounded flat-list-into-every-prompt as the specific anti-pattern to avoid, and that's exactly
   what `assembleAgentInferenceMessage` does today, just capped by count rather than growing without
   bound. It works today because correction volume is small; it is not a lifecycle.

Everything else below is detail supporting that verdict.

(`store.ts`, `runtime-model-routing.ts`, `shared.ts`, `capabilities.ts`), `packages/tool-core/src/`
(registry, domains, parsers, validation), `services/api/src/cp2/agent-business-runtime.ts`,
`services/api/src/agent-harness/`, `services/api/src/cp2/domains/model-templates/strategies.ts`, and
`docs/agent-evaluation-feedback-loop.md`.

## Standard-by-standard comparison

| Standard (paper) | What the paper requires | What Soko does | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| In-context learning (GPT-3), Chain-of-Thought | Task behavior driven by prompt content: few-shot demonstrations, reasoning traces kept as an audit/debug surface | One fixed structured-output instruction (`renderRuntimeModelOutputInstructions`, `packages/tool-core/src/parsers/runtime-proposals.ts:40-52`) listing allowed tool names; **zero few-shot examples anywhere in the live prompt** (`services/api/src/cp2/agent-business-runtime.ts:189-244`); the model's raw reasoning (if any) is discarded once `parseRuntimeModelOutput` extracts the JSON (`packages/tool-core/src/parsers/model-output.ts:10-113`) | **Gap.** No exemplars, no retained trace. Cheap to fix: log the model's raw completion text alongside the parsed proposal for audit, and consider embedding 3-5 worked examples per tool family in `assembleAgentInferenceMessage`. |
| ReAct (interleaved thought/action) | Model emits explicit "thought" steps between actions, auditable, used to replan | None. One model call, one JSON action, no thought field, no loop (`runtime-model-routing.ts:243-255`) | **Not implemented — reasonable for a single-shot classify-and-propose task, but the *lack of a retained rationale* (see row above) is the actual cost.** |
| Toolformer (self-supervised tool-use decision) | Tool-call insertion decided by measurable utility, learned | Tool selection is 100% hand-coded rules + one fixed model output contract; no learning component (confirmed: zero hits for fine-tune/gradient/RL across `cp2` and `tool-core`) | **N/A by design.** This is a closed, developer-curated tool set on purpose (commerce actions need to be enumerable and auditable) — Toolformer's self-supervised discovery doesn't belong in a system whose whole safety model rests on a fixed, reviewed tool registry. |
| InterCode (execute → observe → explicit submit) | Actions are validated as "admissible" before execution; episode ends only on an explicit submit; failures feed back for retry | The confirmation-token gate (`confirmRuntimeAction`, `store.ts:2376-2505`) **is** InterCode's "explicit submit," and `validateRuntimeToolInput` (`packages/tool-core/src/validation/runtime.ts:8-374`) **is** admissibility-checking before execution. What's missing: when execution itself fails (not "user declined confirmation," but a genuine runtime/store error), there's no evidence the failure reason is fed back to the model for a retry — it just becomes an error string in the response. | **Partially met.** The confirm/validate skeleton matches the standard; the retry-on-genuine-failure loop doesn't exist. |
| Reflexion / Self-Refine (self-critique, verbal memory across retries) | A distinct evaluator/critic step scores or critiques the draft before it's finalized; specific, actionable feedback persists across retries | `createRuntimeVerification` (`services/api/src/cp2/domains/agent-runtime/shared.ts:273-292`) is **entirely deterministic**: role permission lookup, confirmation-token match, static input-shape validation. No model call ever critiques another model call's output. Confirmed zero hits for "critique"/"self-refine"/"reflexion" across `agent-runtime` and `tool-core`. | **Not implemented.** For a system this consequence-bounded (every mutating action already requires human confirmation), a full Reflexion loop is probably overkill — but a *narrow* version (log why a `record_payment` proposal was rejected/declined, and don't re-propose the identical malformed draft next turn) would directly improve the merchant experience and costs little. |
| Multi-Agent Collaboration ("oracle" critic, halting supervisor) | A stateless second agent specifically checks for hallucination/malicious action before execution; a supervisor can halt runaway agents | The role-permission check (`roleCan`, `packages/business-core/src/domains/roles.ts:225-227`) and the `maxRuntimeTurnsPerSession = 20` cap (`shared.ts:199`) are a deterministic version of "halting," but there's no oracle-style second-opinion check specifically aimed at *hallucinated* tool inputs (e.g., a fabricated customer name that doesn't exist in the business's own records) — `validateRuntimeToolInput` checks shape, not existence/plausibility against the business's actual data. | **Partial.** Halting exists; hallucination-specific oracle checking does not — worth adding for the specific case of the model inventing a customer/product name that isn't in the business's own catalogue. |
| Voyager / Darwin Gödel Machine / Continual Harness / Meta-Harness / OpenJarvis (self-improving harness, skill library, archived lineage, gated auto-promotion) | Agent capabilities/prompts/harness config evolve via a search loop, gated on held-out eval, with an archive of every variant | `RuntimeToolName` is a **fixed, closed enum** (`packages/tool-core/src/contracts/runtime.ts:96-138`); new capabilities require a developer to hand-edit 4 files (registry, domain definition, validator, capability dispatcher). The one thing in the repo with real DNA in common with this family — `optimizePromptExpertise`/`startImprovementRun` (`services/api/src/cp2/domains/model-templates/strategies.ts:49-135`, `store.ts:870-1090`) — does have a genuine "candidate → evaluate → gate on regression count/score delta → promote" loop, which is structurally the right shape. But it: is manually/API-triggered rather than continuous; compiles approved examples into literal substring-match rules for a *separate* deterministic executor (`executeDeterministicRuleExpertise`), not into the live LLM prompt or a reflective prompt rewrite; and keeps no archive of rejected/inferior variants (Darwin Gödel Machine's central finding is that keeping "bad" variants around matters). | **Real gap, but this is also the family of papers where the frontier itself flags real safety hazards from unattended self-modification** — both Continual Harness and Prime Agent report their own agents discovering and persisting exploits as "skills" when given this kind of autonomy, and both had to build provenance/rollback machinery specifically to contain it. Soko's closed-enum, human-gated tool set is a legitimate stance, not just an oversight — the honest gap is that the *existing* rule-compilation pipeline should feed the live prompt and should keep a lineage, not that the runtime needs open-ended self-modification. |
| GEPA (reflective prompt evolution, Pareto pool, rich textual feedback) | Prompt revisions come from an LLM reflecting on full execution traces (not just scores); multiple candidate prompts tracked per-task, not single best-so-far | The nightly eval (`services/api/scripts/run-ai-eval.ts`) **does** capture rich per-scenario textual feedback (the judge's `reason` string, not just PASS/FAIL) — this is the one place the repo already matches a GEPA-family practice. But nothing feeds that feedback back into an automatic prompt rewrite; a human has to read `/tmp/soko-ai-eval-report.json` and act on it manually. No Pareto pool of prompt variants exists anywhere. | **Partially met on the "capture rich feedback" half; not met on the "close the loop automatically" half.** |
| MemGPT / Recursive Language Models (bounded/hierarchical memory, no unbounded prompt inlining) | Persistent memory lives outside the model's context and is paged in/out via explicit function calls or programmatic access, never inlined wholesale | Owner corrections are retrieved as a flat list, capped by count (`maximumItemsPerScope`) and injected as literal `<memory id="N">` blocks into every prompt (`services/api/src/cp2/agent-business-runtime.ts:210-212, 236-237`); retrieval is bag-of-words keyword overlap (`agent-business-runtime.ts:275-336`), not semantic search; stale items are excluded by a date cutoff, never summarized or archived. `docs/agent-evaluation-feedback-loop.md` states explicitly: "automatic retention cleanup and reusable-workflow promotion are not yet background jobs." | **Real gap, and the repo's own docs already call it out as a known TODO.** This is the one place where "the docs promise X, the code doesn't do X yet" is unambiguous — worth prioritizing before correction volume grows enough to matter. |
| DSPy (typed signatures, declarative modules, compiled bootstrapping) | LM calls are typed, composable modules optimized by a compiler against a metric, not hand-tuned prompt strings | `assembleAgentInferenceMessage`/`compileAgentInstructions` (`agent-business-runtime.ts:120-244`) is a hand-written string template with no typed signature/module abstraction and no automatic bootstrapping against a metric | **Not implemented.** Reasonable given the task shape (classify-or-clarify-or-tool-call is a narrow, well-specified output contract already), but if the prompt template grows more sections over time, DSPy's module boundaries are worth revisiting to keep it maintainable. |
| WebGPT (external grounding, citations, best-of-n ranking) | Ground claims in retrieved, citable evidence; generate multiple candidates and rank via a scorer before returning one | All tool execution reads/writes the business's own store (`executeRuntimeCapability`, `services/api/src/cp2/domains/agent-runtime/capabilities.ts:30-471`); no web browsing, no external retrieval, no citation fields; exactly one completion is generated per turn, never ranked candidates | **N/A by design (external grounding) / gap (best-of-n).** A commerce assistant scoped to one business's own records has no business browsing the open web — that's correctly out of scope, not a deficiency. Best-of-n candidate generation-and-ranking for consequential drafts (e.g., invoice line-item parsing) is a genuinely applicable idea WebGPT's own ablation shows as its single biggest lever, and nothing here does it. |
| METR (task-length-vs-success-rate evaluation methodology) | Measure reliability as success-rate against task difficulty/length, not one aggregate number; explicitly watch for abandonment and repeated-failed-action loops | The nightly eval is 6 fixed single-turn scenarios scored PASS/FAIL by an LLM judge against a threshold (`run-ai-eval.ts:31, 166-168`) — no difficulty grading, no multi-step tasks, no measurement of degradation as conversation length grows | **Gap, but scale-appropriate.** METR's methodology is built for benchmarking frontier-model capability trajectories; a 6-scenario smoke-test golden set for one narrow fallback path is a reasonable-sized eval for this system's actual risk surface. The applicable lesson worth taking is narrower: track turn-count vs. error/clarify rate in production telemetry, since METR's own finding is that models degrade specifically on long, messy, under-specified interactions — which is exactly the shape of a merchant chat session. |
| LangChain harness taxonomy (industry vocabulary, not a research result) | Names existing patterns: `HumanInTheLoopMiddleware`, `SummarizationMiddleware`, `ToolRetryMiddleware`, `ModelFallbackMiddleware`, etc. | Soko's confirmation-token gate is exactly `HumanInTheLoopMiddleware`; `runtime-model-routing.ts`'s infra-failure retry is exactly `ModelFallbackMiddleware`. No equivalent of `SummarizationMiddleware`/`ContextEditingMiddleware` exists (see MemGPT row) | Useful only as vocabulary confirming two things Soko already does right. |

## What's actually worth doing, in priority order

This list is deliberately short — most of the "gaps" above are either out-of-scope by design
(Toolformer, Voyager-style self-modification, WebGPT browsing) or scale-inappropriate for a
6-scenario smoke eval (METR-style benchmarking, DSPy module refactor). Three items would move the
needle without importing risk the frontier papers themselves warn about:

1. **Close the memory-lifecycle gap the docs already admit exists.** Add the "automatic retention
   cleanup" `docs/agent-evaluation-feedback-loop.md:40-41` already promises, before correction volume
   grows past what a flat capped list can serve well. This is the single item where "the standard"
   and "the docs' own stated intent" already agree — it just isn't built.
2. **Retain the model's raw completion text on model-fallback turns**, not just the parsed JSON
   proposal, so a disputed mutating action (a drafted invoice, a payment record) has an auditable
   rationale behind it — ReAct's and Self-Refine's shared insight that the "why" is worth keeping
   even when there's no multi-step loop to interleave it into.
3. **Add an existence/plausibility check for model-proposed customer/product names against the
   business's own catalogue** before showing a confirmation prompt — the "oracle" pattern from the
   multi-agent paper, scoped narrowly to the one failure mode (hallucinated entity names) that
   actually matters for a commerce assistant, not a general second-model-critiques-everything pass.

None of these require adopting agentic-loop machinery (ReAct-style multi-step reasoning, Toolformer
tool-use learning, Voyager-style skill growth, or any of the 2025-2026 self-modifying-harness
patterns) — and given that the two papers closest to that frontier (Continual Harness, Prime Agent)
both report their own systems discovering and persisting exploits when granted that kind of
autonomy, staying with a closed tool registry and human confirmation gate is the right call for a
system that touches real money, not a gap to close.

## Update: second batch shipped

Three more standards-derived improvements landed after this audit, each scoped down from the
paper's literal mechanism to what's actually safe and appropriate for this system:

- **Few-shot examples in the model prompt** (GPT-3, Chain-of-Thought) —
  `renderRuntimeModelFewShotExamples` (`packages/tool-core/src/parsers/runtime-proposals.ts`) adds
  5 fixed worked `<merchant message, JSON output>` examples to the model-fallback prompt, filtered
  to the tools actually allowed for the request. Deliberately small and hand-written, not learned
  or optimized — this is a cheap correctness aid, not a DSPy/GEPA-style pipeline.
- **Bounded retry on genuine execution failures** (InterCode, Reflexion) — scoped down from literal
  "auto-retry" after discovering that blindly re-invoking a mutating tool call risks double
  execution for writes with no verified idempotency guarantee. What shipped instead:
  `confirmRuntimeAction` (`services/api/src/cp2/domains/agent-runtime/store.ts`) now catches an
  execution-time `Cp2Error`, surfaces its specific message via `runtimeExecutionFailureResponse`
  instead of crashing the request, and — only when the codebase's own existing `Cp2Error.retryable`
  flag says so — keeps the confirmation token alive so a plain follow-up "confirm" retries the same
  already-approved action. Deliberately scoped to the explicit-confirmation path only: the
  auto-execute path (hashtag-invoked, confirmation-free tools like `workspace.deliver`) still
  throws through unchanged, because the messaging domain's own `createRuntimeTurn` caller
  (`services/api/src/cp2/domains/messaging/store.ts`) deliberately depends on that for its own
  `isRecoverableAgentModelChatError` classification — confirmed by a real regression
  (`tests/workspace-conversation-delivery.test.ts`) the first, too-broad version of this change
  caused and then fixed by narrowing scope, not by weakening the new behavior.
- **Clarify-rate / turn-length telemetry** (METR) — `AgentEvaluationSummary` gained `clarifying`
  (a distinct count, no longer folded into the broader `partial` bucket) and
  `averageSessionTurnCountAtClarify`, sourced from a `turnCount` field added to the existing
  sampled evaluation-event metadata. Surfaced in the owner-facing settings UI
  (`apps/web/src/AgentRetentionPanel.tsx`). A rising average is the concrete, traceable signal for
  METR's finding that models degrade on long, under-specified interactions — not an impression.

All three shipped with tests (`tests/runtime-model-few-shot-examples.test.ts`,
`tests/runtime-execution-failure-response.test.ts`,
`tests/runtime-execution-failure-graceful-degradation.test.ts`,
`tests/agent-evaluation-clarify-rate.test.ts`), verified against the full 1196-test suite, and the
two behavior-changing ones (execution-failure handling, clarify-rate metadata) were bug-fix-critic
checked by reverting the change and confirming the new tests fail with the exact pre-fix symptom
before restoring it.
