# ADR: Social authentication library strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Soko.market already has a custom Fastify auth implementation with:

- phone/email OTP
- OAuth state and CSRF validation
- server-side OAuth token exchange
- encrypted OAuth token persistence
- session cookies
- account/user/session relational tables
- Drizzle/Postgres migrations

The product requirement asks for social signup/login without adding Prisma, Supabase, or a duplicate data layer.

## Decision

Continue using the existing custom CP2 auth stack and extend it for the requested social signup/login providers.

Do not introduce Better Auth, Auth.js, Passport, Supabase Auth, Clerk, or another overlapping framework in this phase. Firebase Auth is used only as the transport for phone OTP verification, not as the application session framework.

## Rationale

- Avoids two competing session systems.
- Preserves existing PIN, OTP, and business ownership flows.
- Keeps Neon/Postgres and Drizzle as the database path.
- Minimizes migration risk while CP2 compatibility tables are still being retired.
- Allows provider secrets and OAuth token exchanges to remain server-side.

## Consequences

- The auth layer remains app-owned code and needs internal maintenance.
- Provider-specific behavior must be implemented and tested in this repo.
- A future framework migration is still possible, but should be handled as a separate ADR and migration project.
