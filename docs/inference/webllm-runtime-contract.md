# WebLLM runtime contract

## Supported runtime

Soko integrates `@mlc-ai/web-llm` 0.2.84 as a lazy-loaded, dedicated Web Worker adapter. It is
available only when the capability layer selects WebGPU. WebLLM is not imported by the Render API
and does not require a persistent inference service.

The initial approved profiles are:

| Soko profile                   | WebLLM model ID                     | Weight revision                            |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `smollm2-360m-instruct-webllm` | `SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC` | `3a622fd89e0216e8bb10c410c007c786baa8a033` |
| `qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-webllm` | `Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC` | `32ff081fe7e4dfe4ffb167b94c66fdf11e02b8ad` |

The compatible WebAssembly model libraries are resolved from WebLLM's 0.2.84
`prebuiltAppConfig`, then rewritten from the mutable GitHub `main` URL to
`binary-mlc-llm-libs@025bcaf3780fa8254f5e5efd3bfea0a5397248f4`.

The MLC weights and model library are different artifacts. Both must remain pinned.

## Runtime contract

`BrowserRuntimeContract` is the stable Soko boundary:

```ts
interface BrowserRuntimeContract {
  schemaVersion: 1;
  adapterId: "transformers-js" | "webllm";
  adapterVersion: string;
  libraryRevision: string | null;
  runtime: "browser-webgpu" | "browser-wasm";
  backend: "webgpu" | "wasm";
  streaming: true;
  cancellation: true;
  tokenCounting: "exact" | "estimated";
  checkpointKinds: Array<"task-state" | "token-replay" | "native-kv">;
  nativeStateFormat: string | null;
}
```

WebLLM 0.2.84 does not expose a supported tokenizer-count API through
`MLCEngineInterface`, so Soko advertises `tokenCounting: "estimated"` and uses a conservative
message estimate. Its real generation still runs within the selected profile's context, output,
memory, and wall-time budgets.

## Checkpoint contract

`BrowserCheckpointCompatibilityContract` describes the portable representation:

```ts
interface BrowserCheckpointCompatibilityContract {
  schemaVersion: 1;
  checkpointKind: "task-state";
  taskStateSchema: "soko.browser-task-state.v2";
  modelFamilyId: string;
  sourceModelId: string;
  sourceModelRevision: string;
  sourceAdapterId: "transformers-js" | "webllm";
  promptRepresentation: "role-content-messages";
  portableAcrossAdapters: true;
}
```

A checkpoint can be restored through another adapter only when:

1. it is an unexpired interrupted task-state checkpoint;
2. account, shop, conversation, request, and objective scopes match;
3. both contracts use `soko.browser-task-state.v2`;
4. model family and role/content representation match.

The source model ID, revision, and adapter remain recorded for auditability but do not prevent
logical recovery across adapters in the same model family.

## Explicit non-contracts

The following are not portable contracts:

- a WebLLM KV cache;
- Transformers.js/ONNX Runtime tensors;
- WebGPU buffers;
- raw MLC model artifacts;
- GGUF files;
- sampler state not represented in the task checkpoint.

Soko therefore publishes only `checkpointKinds: ["task-state"]` and
`nativeStateFormat: null`. A future native or token-replay format must receive a new schema,
compatibility validator, corruption checks, and runtime-specific conformance tests before it can
be advertised.

## Lifecycle

1. Soko selects a compatible WebLLM profile.
2. The adapter builds an app configuration from WebLLM's pinned package catalogue.
3. Weight and model-library URLs are rewritten to immutable revisions.
4. `CreateWebWorkerMLCEngine` loads the profile in a dedicated worker.
5. A bounded readiness completion must succeed before the model is enabled.
6. Generation streams through the common `BrowserModelEngine` contract.
7. Deadline or cancellation calls `interruptGenerate`.
8. Page lifecycle and failure checkpoints use the common structured task-state store.
9. Model removal unloads the worker and deletes both Transformers.js and WebLLM caches.

## Database and workflow connection

The browser cache remains device-local, while the authenticated API persists the portable
assignment in `cp2_browser_inference_assignments`. The record is scoped by account, owner, shop,
and device. It contains:

- the selected model, family, and immutable model revision;
- the runtime and checkpoint compatibility contracts;
- the device tier, enabled state, and readiness state;
- the latest successful local execution time or bounded failure code.

It never contains prompts, retrieved shop context, generated replies, KV caches, or model bytes.
The database record is therefore an assignment and health attestation, not a remote inference
payload.

The frontend workflow is:

1. Load IndexedDB state and the matching server assignment when model settings open.
2. Download and verify the model locally.
3. Persist the exact portable contracts only after the readiness completion succeeds.
4. Route eligible short chat through the browser provider.
5. Record success or a bounded error code asynchronously; chat does not wait on telemetry.
6. Disable the database assignment when browser inference is switched off.
7. Remove both cached model state and the database assignment when the owner deletes the model.

Migration `041_browser_inference_assignments.sql` creates the Neon table and contract constraints.
Apply it before deploying API code that requires this workflow.
