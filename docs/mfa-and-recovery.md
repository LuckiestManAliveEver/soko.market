# MFA and recovery

Soko supports TOTP as a second factor and passkeys as a strong authentication method. TOTP setup
creates an encrypted secret and does not activate the factor until the user supplies a valid code.
Replay of the same TOTP time step is rejected. Enrollments generate single-use recovery codes; only
their hashes are persisted, and newly generated codes invalidate the old set.

Password recovery uses a purpose-bound email verification transaction for a linked, verified email.
Phone and SMS recovery are unavailable. Responses for email identifiers are worded generically to
reduce account enumeration. A successful email challenge grants only the ability to complete that
recovery transaction, not a general login session, and the grant is consumed once. Existing sessions,
passkeys, passwords, and saved recovery codes remain the other supported return paths.

After password reset, existing device sessions are revoked. Security-sensitive factor changes and
recovery-code regeneration require an authenticated session and verification appropriate to the
operation.
