## Fixed in this audit

- Replaced the receipt worker health-only loop with an HTTP scan consumer.
- Sent actual image/PDF bytes from the frontend instead of empty extracted text.
- Added OCR response validation, retries, timeout, concurrency, upload-size, image-edge, and PDF-page enforcement.
- Connected IndexedDB mutations to the server queue and automatic reconnect replay.
- Prevented bulk replay from repeatedly executing non-retryable conflicts or ignoring retry backoff.
- Recovered interrupted `processing` queue items after hydration and converted unexpected replay
  failures into retryable failed items.
- Pruned expired sync tombstones and synchronized removals to PostgreSQL on the next durable save.
- Stopped swallowing PostgreSQL save failures: `flush()` now rejects and health reports `degraded`.
- Added an HTTP response barrier so successful mutation responses wait for queued PostgreSQL
  persistence.
- Scoped queued chat messages to the authenticated account, removed unsafe legacy entries, and
  stopped retrying permanent client/conflict errors.
- Included quarantined shop records in the scheduled deletion purge runner.
- Connected queued network invites to a signed delivery webhook and persisted `sent` or `failed`
  delivery state.
- Added PostgreSQL `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` fan-out with source-instance suppression, dedicated listener
  connections, automatic reconnect, and health reporting.
- Replaced fire-and-forget push/email delivery with a persisted retry queue, scheduled worker,
  exponential backoff, and terminal dead-letter state.
- Added signed malware-scanner and object-storage adapters, retained-source provenance, and
  production fail-closed scanner configuration.

## Deployment dependencies

- OCR requires the worker container and `OCR_WORKER_URL`; PaddleOCR model startup can be slow on the
  first request.
- Migration `028_data_pipeline_infrastructure.sql` must be applied before starting this API version.
- Cross-instance realtime fan-out uses the same PostgreSQL database as the durable cursor journal;
  no separate broker is required.
- Network invite delivery requires `NETWORK_INVITE_WEBHOOK_URL` and
  `NETWORK_INVITE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Without them, invites remain queued.
- Push and email providers still require their normal credentials. Failed delivery records remain
  durable and are retried while the notification runner is enabled.
- Production binary upload routes require the signed malware scanner unless
  `REQUIRE_BINARY_UPLOAD_SECURITY=false` is deliberately set. Retained import sources use the signed
  object-storage adapter when configured; receipt bytes remain ephemeral.
