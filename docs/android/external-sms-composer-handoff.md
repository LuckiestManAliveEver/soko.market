# External SMS composer handoff

## Repository diagnosis

Soko is currently a React 19/Vite progressive web application in `apps/web`. It is not a native
Android app, Capacitor app, React Native app, Flutter app, or Trusted Web Activity. There is no
Gradle project, Android manifest, Kotlin source, or native bridge implementation in this
repository. Android release identity is only proposed and verified by
`config/android-release-identity.json`; `documentation/CP26_ANDROID_RELEASE_IDENTITY.md` proposes a
future TWA.

The authenticated chat send flow is:

1. `ChatSurface` in `apps/web/src/SokoApplication.tsx` renders the composer and calls `onSend`.
2. `sendChatDraft()` creates an optimistic chat item, clears the draft, encrypts human direct
   messages, and posts to `POST /v1/messages`.
3. `services/api/src/cp2/routes.ts` parses that request.
4. `services/api/src/cp2/store.ts` currently accepts only the `soko` server delivery channel and
   records delivery attempts.

Direct-conversation creation accepts an exact phone number or email, but the API rejects contacts
without a Soko account. Conversation participant responses identify accounts, shops, and agents;
they do not expose another account's private phone number. Shop identities use alphanumeric global
IDs such as `254A12345678`, and are not telephone numbers. Optional browser contact selection exists
for network sync, not chat delivery. There was no SMS, telephone, or external-intent helper and no
dual-SIM handling.

## Mode A implementation

`apps/web/src/messaging/sms-handoff.ts` defines the explicit composer channels:

- `soko`
- `sms_external_app`
- `sms_native`
- `unsupported`

Normal chat remains `soko`. SMS is selected only when the user presses **Send as SMS**.
`sms_native` is disabled; this change does not send with `SmsManager` or make Soko a default SMS
handler.

The confirmation sheet:

- keeps the original Soko draft and attachments untouched;
- collects a phone number when the active conversation does not expose one;
- shows the contact label independently of the normalized number;
- previews editable text;
- warns about carrier charges and messages longer than 160 characters;
- explains that attachments are not included;
- offers Cancel and Continue to SMS app.

After handoff, Soko does not create a chat message and does not report sent, delivered, read, or
failed-delivery state. It only says that the composer handoff was requested.

## Phone normalization

The existing `libphonenumber-js` dependency is reused. Numbers are normalized to E.164. A default
country is used only for input without an international prefix. Kenyan `0712…`, `011…`, `254…`,
and `+254…` forms are supported. Valid international `+` numbers are not forced to Kenya.
Empty/invalid input and values containing letters or the `soko:` prefix are rejected.

## Android and PWA behavior

The PWA fallback builds a user-initiated, safely encoded
`sms:+254…?body=<encoded text>` navigation. Android delegates that URI to a compatible handler and
the selected SMS app or Android system owns dual-SIM choice. No SMS app package is hard-coded.

A typed `window.SokoAndroid.openSmsComposer(recipient, body)` contract is preferred when a future
Android wrapper supplies it. That wrapper must implement Mode A with `Intent.ACTION_SENDTO`, a
`smsto:` URI, the `sms_body` extra, and `resolveActivity()` before `startActivity()`. It must not
export an intent receiver or accept arbitrary inbound intent data.

Browser navigation does not expose whether an SMS handler actually opened or whether the user sent
the message. Desktop use is rejected with an explanation. Mobile browser URI handling varies by
browser and installed SMS apps. A production Android wrapper therefore still needs a separate
native implementation and device tests.

## Privacy telemetry

`POST /v1/message-handoffs` writes a minimal audit event containing the requesting account,
optional shop and conversation IDs, `sms_external_app`, timestamp, handoff status, and normalized
error code. The phone number, contact label, and message body are not sent to this endpoint.

## Permissions

This implementation adds no Android manifest and requests no SMS permissions. In particular it
does not request `READ_SMS`, `RECEIVE_SMS`, `SEND_SMS`, or `WRITE_SMS`.
