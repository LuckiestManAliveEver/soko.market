/**
 * Marketplace mode, the buy-intent card (MarketplaceModeCard, labeled "Buy" in the UI), and guest
 * browsing all live in one window now: the standard ChatSurface shell. Guests used to be diverted
 * to a separate, stripped-down GuestMarketplaceChat screen the moment they had no session - that
 * duplicated the search UX and dropped storefront browsing, cart, and quick prompts. ChatSurface
 * already gated every session-only affordance behind isAuthenticated (composer, new
 * session/conversation, notifications) and already carried a "Browse as guest" welcome action and
 * onSignUp/onLogIn wiring, so removing the diversion is enough to give guests the full buy-intent
 * experience inside the same shell everyone else uses.
