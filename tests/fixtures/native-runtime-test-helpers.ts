 * Activates a generic, capability-compatible model as the global default runtime's primary

 * RUNTIME_MODEL_NOT_CONFIGURED. Tests that only need the native runtime binding to resolve to
 * *something* - because they inject their own `runtimeModelProvider`/`modelRuntimeAdapterResolver`
 * and don't care which modelId is selected - can use this instead of constructing their own
 * `AiModelSummary` fixture. See services/api/src/cp2/domains/native-runtime/store.ts and
 * docs/architecture/provider-neutral-runtime.md (no model vendor is required for Soko to boot;
 * this mirrors an operator choosing one, not a startup requirement).
