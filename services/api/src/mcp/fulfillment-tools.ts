/**
 * Corridor fulfillment over MCP (docs/architecture/corridor-fulfillment.md, "MCP tools").
 *
 * Every public fulfillment operation that the HTTP surface exposes is one tool here, declared as
 * data: name, scope, JSON input schema and a `run` that parses with the same parsers as the HTTP
 * routes (cp2/domains/fulfillment/input.ts) and calls the same FulfillmentService / Cp2Store
 * method. No fulfillment rule lives in this file. The caller runs `run` inside
 * `store.runFulfillmentForMcp`, so the service authorizes the MCP principal against its business
 * membership and role exactly as it would a browser session (A8, tenant isolation).
 *
 * Reads need `mcp:read`; mutations need `mcp:act`. Each mutation declares its `retry` contract
 * (see `RetryContract`) and appends it to its description, so what an agent reads about repeating
 * a call is true: `replay` tools require an `idempotencyKey`, `refused` and `deduplicated` tools
 * accept one, and the `absolute` tool takes none. Gram values are decimal strings in both
 * directions (A22).

 *   (`idempotency_key_reused`). The key is required.
 * - refused: a state transition; once it has happened, repeating it is refused
 *   (`manifest_not_open`, `stop_already_recorded`, ...) instead of being applied twice.
 * - deduplicated: the domain keeps one result (one intake per order, one evaluation per corridor
 *   and business day), so repeating it returns that result.
 * - absolute: writes an absolute value; repeating it writes the same value again. The business
 *   timezone lives in the Cp2Store, which cannot share a transaction with the fulfillment
 *   idempotency table, so this is the one tool that does not use a key.
