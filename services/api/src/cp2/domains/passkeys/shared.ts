/**
 * Twelfth slice of in-process domain modularization for the Cp2Store monolith (see
 * docs/architecture/domain-modularization-roadmap.md). Owns `passkeys`, `passkeyCeremonies`, and
 * `passkeyPinRecoveryGrants` - the first slice carved out of the "core auth/identity/session"
 * kernel that an earlier row of the roadmap doc flagged as too large/risky to extract as one
 * unit. Passkeys turned out extractable with the exact same pattern as every other domain -
 * nothing here required a raw mutable reference into `sessions`/`accounts`, confirmed by reading
 * every ceremony-completion method body directly rather than inferring from names.
 *
 * `completePasskeyAuthentication` creates a session via a `createSession` callback (the "call
 * back up" pattern used throughout this whole effort) rather than writing `sessions` directly.
 * The one real coupling problem was `recoverPhoneAccountPinWithPasskey`, which raw-iterated
 * `sessions` to revoke every other session for the account and raw-read/wrote
 * `accountPinHashes` to reset the login PIN - both patterns already duplicated inline in several
 * `Cp2Store`-only methods (`changePassword`, `resetRecoveredPassword`, `revokeSessionsForAccount`),
 * confirming `sessions`/`accountPinHashes` are core-kernel state that legitimately stays put. Four
 * small new callbacks (`revokeOtherSessionsForAccount`, `resetAccountPinHash`,
 * `hasAccountPinHash`, `hasPasswordCredential`) resolve it the same way every other domain
 * resolves a dependency on not-yet-extracted core state - Cp2Store implements each as a one-line
 * wrapper around Maps it already owns. `normalizePin` is injected as a callback too (rather than
 * moved or value-imported back from store.ts, which would recreate the circular-value-import
 * problem `cp2-error.ts`/`money.ts`/`text-normalization.ts` were split out to avoid) so that
 * `recoverPhoneAccountPinWithPasskey` keeps validating the PIN format at the exact same point in
 * its control flow as before the extraction - normalizing it lazily inside a hashing callback
 * instead would silently reorder which error wins when both the PIN and the session are invalid.
 *
 * **Known pre-existing gap, preserved as-is, not silently fixed:** `passkeyPinRecoveryGrants` is
 * never swept by `deleteAccountOwnedData` - no `deleteScopedMapRecords` call for it exists
 * anywhere. Low severity: it is a bare `Map<sessionId, expiresAt>` with no scope-identifying
 * object field, so the generic sweep helper would not apply to it unmodified anyway, and
 * `prunePasskeyPinRecoveryGrants` already self-heals once the underlying session is purged
 * (`getSession(sessionId, now) === null`), on top of the 5-minute TTL bounding the exposure.
