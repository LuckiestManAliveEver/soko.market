/**
 * The sole place `AgentModelBindingSummary` (the wire shape `AgentModelPanel.tsx`/
 * `QuickRuntimeSwitcher.tsx` already depend on) is ever constructed - as a read-through projection
 * of the native runtime graph, not a second persisted representation. Native bindings carry no
 * `executionMode`/`permissions` concept (those were on-device-execution-era fields the frontend
 * sends but never reads back, see AgentModelPanel.tsx/QuickRuntimeSwitcher.tsx `executionMode:
 * "LOCAL_FIRST"`); this projection fills them with the values that are actually true of the current
 * architecture ("always backend/remote-shop-device hosted") rather than round-tripping retired
 * on-device vocabulary.
